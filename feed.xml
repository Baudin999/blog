<p>Writing and blogging have always been incredibly important. Most of the things I’ve learned have been through a medium like this. Of course, I have learned a lot from watching YouTube videos or conversing with colleagues, but the written medium stands out like no other. After two decades in this business, I am ready to contribute to the conversation.</p>

<p>My field, the field of software development, feels disrupted. It feels like it is no longer the discipline it once was. There are too many people who have traded skills for salary. Just look at the number of people calling themselves “React Devs”. With these writings, I want to express myself, and if, for some reason, people find it helpful, I would enjoy that a lot.</p>

<p>As a first topic, I want to write about writing. To write something, is to put something on paper which translates your inner thoughts into distinct words which trigger a sensation or a memory in the minds of the reader. Writing is not something I take lightly. It is very difficult to get my message accross in such a way that the reader actually understands what I am writing. But I have learned some tricks which I would like to share with you.</p>

<h2 id="first-rule-of-writing">First rule of writing</h2>
<p>You should never write something in a vacuum. You will need people to review and revise your work. You will need people you trust around you challenging your assumptions and your writing style. You might feel like you have articulated your point well, but that is not up to you! That is up to the reader. So the first rule of writing is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ask for help</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="second-rule-of-writing">Second rule of writing</h2>
<p>To write something, is to perserve a moment in time. A moment when your brain fired neurons in that particular order. A moment when
you saw the light bounce of off a metalic object in such a way that it inspired you to put ink to paper. This moment in time, this 
amalgamation of luck and skill resulted in words. These words contain your views, your opinions, your perception of the world in that
moment.</p>

<p>Do not be afraid of that moment, but realise that what you are writing is going to age. And most likely, it will not age well. Embrace
that, but do everything you can to realise that you are not writing for yourself, but you are writing for future readers. Keep your 
words readable, keep hidden knowledge to a minimum and keep you language short and well spoken. The second rule of writing is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write for the future, not for the present</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="third-rule-of-writing">Third rule of writing</h2>
<p>Do not think that there is only one way or one medium. When you write, you take detours. When you watch, you want quick successions of
setup and resolution. Think about how things translate from one medium to the next. For example, this blog post might end up as a 
YouTube video. But I cannot “just read” this out loud. I will have to rewrite.</p>

<p>The third rule of writing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every word, every sentence has a purpose</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this first post. I also hope you’ve noticed that these rules are not only for writing prose, but are also 
extremely important when writing code. I will leave the explenation of this to the reader. But we would all do well if we remember
these rules.</p>]]></content><author><name>Carlos Kelkboom</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="Writing" /><category term="Personal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, World Writing and blogging have always been incredibly important.
