# Technical Director - Artificial Core

I cannot begin to state how grateful I am for the opportunity to build a game. I love games, especially MMO RPGs and to be working on one is a privilege. It comes with extreme technical challenges and unique opportunities to improve myself. This article is an accumulation of experiences I had over the last year(s). It will be critical at points but I want to make it very clear, creating a game like Corepunk is amazing and I would not trade this experience for anything!

## Legacy Code 

The beautiful game called [Corepunk](https://corepunk.com/) had been in development for eight years before I joined the company. Only one developer from the original team was still there. The code was what you can expect from a project in development for years, it was messy.
