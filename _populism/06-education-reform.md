## Education Reform: Building a Foundation for the Future

Addressing the systemic erosion of trust in society requires a fundamental overhaul of our education system. By implementing targeted reforms, we can equip the next generation with critical thinking skills, scientific literacy, and ethical grounding necessary for a resilient and informed society.
