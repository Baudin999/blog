Humans are terrible at uncertainty. Faced with the unknown, we fill the void with patterns, stories, and beliefs—whether they are true or not. This is what religion has done for centuries: disguised itself as moral philosophy while feeding on fear and ignorance. At its core, it is no different from any other human institution: corrupt, power-hungry, and riddled with hypocrisy. It has flourished by preying on the one thing people cannot handle—the void of not knowing.

Take a moment to peel back the glittering facade, and the rot becomes obvious:
- The Catholic Church, for centuries, has systemically abused children, protected the abusers, and built its reputation on lies and silence.
- It has fueled hatred against LGBTQ+ individuals, insisting that love is a sin if it doesn’t conform to their narrow, outdated ideals.
- It has torn families apart, ostracizing those who dare question their faith or walk away from its grip.

And yet, this institution still stands, cloaked in its self-proclaimed moral superiority. It has paid billions in damages but continues to hide criminals in its ranks. How can we, as a society, accept this? The answer lies in our fear—fear of losing connection to family, of breaking away from tradition, of facing the void with nothing but uncertainty.

Religion claims ownership over truth and morality, but its foundation is built on unprovable promises. A virgin birth. A resurrection. Eternal life for the faithful. These are accepted without question. But replace these ideas with something modern—5G towers spreading COVID, or a secret cabal of elites drinking children’s blood—and suddenly, they are ridiculous. Can you tell me what is stranger? A resurrection or 5G conspiracies? Logically, there is no difference in “wrongness.” One is mainstream, the other fringe, but both represent the same willingness to accept untruths as long as they fit into the narrative we crave.

Dogmatic beliefs are not harmless. They have seeped into our society, corroding critical thinking and paving the way for conspiracies to take root. When parents refuse life-saving vaccinations for their children because “God will take care of them,” this is not faith. It’s abuse. When people abandon science because it doesn’t align with their worldview, they open the door to chaos. We’ve normalized irrationality by allowing certain lies to stand unchallenged for centuries. Now, when trust in media and science erodes, is it any wonder that people turn to new dogmas for salvation?

These beliefs are multiplying: the earth is flat, vaccines cause autism, humans and dinosaurs coexisted, climate change is a hoax. They gain traction because we’ve created a society where belief outweighs truth, where questioning established narratives is seen as rebellious rather than rational. But let’s not forget that even these modern conspiracies trace their roots back to religion. “The earth is flat” echoes ancient religious cosmology. “Humans and dinosaurs coexisted” comes from creationist fantasies. It’s all the same pattern: a refusal to face reality and an insistence on clinging to comforting lies.

## Case studie: Vaccins cause autism

The belief that vaccines cause autism traces back to a 1998 study published in *The Lancet* by Andrew Wakefield, a British doctor. The study claimed to identify a link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism in children. However, it later emerged that Wakefield had serious conflicts of interest: he was being paid by lawyers who were suing vaccine manufacturers and had filed a patent for an alternative vaccine. These motivations led him to falsify data and manipulate the study to align with his claims. His paper included only 12 children—an extremely small and statistically insignificant sample size—and was retracted by *The Lancet* in 2010 after an investigation exposed its fraudulent nature.

The paper ignited a firestorm. Media coverage amplified Wakefield’s claims, often presenting them uncritically. Parents, concerned for their children's safety, began to delay or refuse vaccinations, leading to declining immunization rates. Celebrities like Jenny McCarthy championed the anti-vaccine cause, lending it a public platform. The medical community, however, was quick to respond: numerous large-scale studies involving hundreds of thousands of children found no link between vaccines and autism. Despite this, the damage was done—vaccination rates in some areas plummeted, and diseases like measles, previously under control, began resurging globally.

Wakefield’s claims were utterly discredited. Investigations revealed that he had falsified data, manipulated case histories, and misrepresented facts. For example, some of the children in his study had already shown signs of autism before receiving the vaccine, contradicting his conclusions. Wakefield was stripped of his medical license, and his work is now regarded as one of the most egregious cases of scientific fraud in modern history. Universities and medical schools frequently use this case as a cautionary tale, teaching future scientists and doctors about the ethical responsibilities of researchers and the dangers of allowing personal interests to interfere with scientific integrity.

Despite overwhelming evidence debunking the vaccine-autism link, the belief persists among certain groups, including some highly educated, left-leaning parents. These individuals often prioritize natural living and holistic health, leading to distrust of pharmaceutical companies and modern medicine. The internet has amplified this skepticism, creating echo chambers where misinformation thrives. For many, this belief is less about evidence and more about identity—rejecting vaccines aligns with broader worldviews about personal autonomy, distrust of corporations, and protecting children from perceived harm. 

This case study highlights the complexity of combating misinformation: intelligence and education do not necessarily immunize individuals against believing falsehoods when those beliefs resonate with their values.

## How dogmatic beliefs empower Populists

Populism, thrives in an environment where dogmatic beliefs and a lack of trust in traditional truths. The emotional manipulation inherent in populist rhetoric mirrors the mechanisms of dogmatic belief systems, which thrive on simplicity and certainty. Just as dogmas offer comforting answers to life’s uncertainties, populist leaders craft narratives that appeal to deeply held fears and desires, casting “the people” as virtuous victims and “the elite” as corrupt oppressors. This framework preys on the same human instinct for binary thinking, leveraging the erosion of trust in institutions like media, science, the law and government to position themselves as the only source of truth.

The lack of trust in truths exacerbates the spread of populist ideologies by creating fertile ground for misinformation and conspiracy theories. In this void, people gravitate toward narratives that resonate emotionally, regardless of their factual basis. Populist leaders amplify these narratives, often framing themselves as the sole arbiters of authenticity in a world full of deceit. This dynamic mirrors the appeal of dogmatic belief systems, where adherents reject evidence-based reasoning in favor of emotionally satisfying myths. a

Populism also thrives by prioritizing the "popular" over the "principled," a hallmark of dogmatic thinking. Just as dogmatic beliefs resist challenges to their internal logic, populist movements dismiss inconvenient truths or principles that conflict with their agenda. This strategy is evident in the populist reliance on oversimplified narratives: complex societal issues like climate change or economic inequality are reduced to "us versus them" battles. Solutions are framed in binary terms, fostering division rather than collaboration. The rejection of nuance in favor of simplistic binaries aligns closely with the way dogmatic systems operate, where questioning is seen as betrayal.

Ultimately, populism, as redefined, uses the same mechanisms as dogmatic beliefs to enforce its dominance: fear, exclusion, and distrust.

## Conclusion

For centuries, religion provided answers to humanity’s greatest uncertainties, often filling the gaps in knowledge. Today, as trust in traditional sources of truth—science, journalism, and institutions—erodes, new dogmas arise to take their place. These beliefs, whether rooted in conspiracy theories or misinformation, thrive in an environment of fear and uncertainty. The case of vaccines and autism demonstrates how dangerous these dogmas can be when left unchecked.
