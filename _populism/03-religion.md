Humans are inherently uncomfortable with uncertainty. Faced with the unknown, we construct stories, patterns, and beliefs—regardless of their validity. Religion has long been the most effective mechanism for this, masquerading as moral philosophy while preying on fear and ignorance. At its core, religion thrives on unprovable claims, offering comforting lies in place of hard truths. It is no different from any other human institution: corrupt, power-hungry, and hypocritical. The difference is that religion elevates its deceit to a sacred status, demanding unquestioning obedience while eroding intellectual and moral integrity.

Take, for instance, the Catholic Church. Behind its facade of moral authority lies centuries of systemic abuse, cover-ups, and outright lies. It has sheltered predators, suppressed truth, and wielded its influence to ostracize anyone who dared question its dogma. This is not an accident; it is by design. The Church, like any power structure, relies on maintaining control, often by ensuring that its followers are intellectually subdued and morally dependent on its guidance.

Religious dogma feeds on bad faith arguments designed to suppress dissent. It insists that the faithful accept unprovable claims—a virgin birth, a resurrection, eternal damnation for the disobedient—not because they are true but because questioning them threatens the institution’s power. These beliefs are wielded as tools to whip up the masses, to enforce conformity, and to suppress intellectual independence. Consider the Church's historical stance against science, from Galileo to Darwin. Each challenge to its authority was met not with reasoned debate but with threats, persecution, and censorship.

The parallels between religious institutions and populist movements are striking. Both thrive on emotional manipulation, reducing complex realities to simplistic, binary choices. Religion has always been a tool to control the masses, ensuring they accept authority without question. Modern populists use the same tactics, preying on intellectual weakness and sowing division to consolidate power.


### Modern Dogma and the Rise of Conspiracy Theories

As trust in traditional institutions like the media and science erodes, new dogmas and conspiracy theories fill the void. These beliefs often mimic religious dogma, demanding acceptance without evidence and punishing dissent with ostracism. The difference is that while religious institutions promise salvation, modern dogmas offer rebellion—a sense of belonging to a group that sees through the lies of the mainstream.

Consider the rise of flat Earth theory, anti-vaccine movements, or QAnon. These modern dogmas demand belief in clearly insane ideas, from secret cabals controlling the world to science denying fundamental truths about the universe. Just as religion suppresses critical thought with threats of eternal damnation, conspiracy theories discourage questioning by casting skeptics as part of the "enemy." 

Conspiracies like "vaccines cause autism" or "climate change is a hoax" or "climate change will kill us all in 10 years" rely on the same emotional manipulation that religion has perfected. They offer simple answers to complex problems: distrust science, reject expertise, and follow the chosen truth-tellers who claim to have uncovered the hidden reality. These dogmas create intellectual weakness, fostering a population incapable of critical thinking, and, most dangerously, one that is easily manipulated.

### Undermining Truth, Suppressing Inquiry

Dogmatic belief systems, whether religious or modern, share one key goal: to undermine truth and suppress inquiry. They thrive on intellectual laziness, encouraging followers to replace questions with loyalty and skepticism with submission. This is not accidental. A population trained to accept absurdities without question is a population that can be controlled.

By normalizing untruths—whether they are ancient myths about divine miracles or modern conspiracies about global elites—dogmatic systems weaken society’s capacity for logical reasoning. This intellectual erosion is not just a side effect; it is the goal. A populace that accepts the clearly insane without question will also accept manipulation, oppression, and lies from those in power.

Religious institutions and populist leaders alike understand this. Both rely on whipping up the masses with emotionally charged narratives, creating a dichotomy between “us” and “them.” Religious dogma casts the faithful as righteous and outsiders as sinful. Populism does the same, painting “the people” as virtuous and “the elite” as corrupt. Both suppress nuance, enforce conformity, and punish critical thought.

### Conclusion: The Danger of Weak Minds

The systematic undermining of truth and reason is one of the most dangerous trends of our time. Dogmatic belief systems, whether ancient or modern, corrode critical thinking and foster intellectual dependence. By normalizing absurdity and rejecting nuance, they create populations that are easy to manipulate, whether by religious institutions or populist leaders.

To resist this trend, society must reject dogma in all its forms. We must prioritize truth over comfort, inquiry over obedience, and intellectual strength over submission. Without these values, we risk descending further into a world where belief outweighs truth, and manipulation becomes the norm.

Humans are terrible at uncertainty. Faced with the unknown, we fill the void with patterns, stories, and beliefs—whether they are true or not. This is what religion has done for centuries: disguised itself as moral philosophy while feeding on fear and ignorance. At its core, it is no different from any other human institution: corrupt, power-hungry, and riddled with hypocrisy. It has flourished by preying on the one thing people cannot handle—the void of not knowing.

Take a moment to peel back the glittering facade, and the rot becomes obvious:
- The Catholic Church, for centuries, has systemically abused children, protected the abusers, and built its reputation on lies and silence.
- It has fueled hatred against LGBTQ+ individuals, insisting that love is a sin if it doesn’t conform to their narrow, outdated ideals.
- It has torn families apart, ostracizing those who dare question their faith or walk away from its grip.

And yet, this institution still stands, cloaked in its self-proclaimed moral superiority. It has paid billions in damages but continues to hide criminals in its ranks. How can we, as a society, accept this? The answer lies in our fear—fear of losing connection to family, of breaking away from tradition, of facing the void with nothing but uncertainty.

Religion claims ownership over truth and morality, but its foundation is built on unprovable promises. A virgin birth. A resurrection. Eternal life for the faithful. These are accepted without question. But replace these ideas with something modern—5G towers spreading COVID, or a secret cabal of elites drinking children’s blood—and suddenly, they are ridiculous. Can you tell me what is stranger? A resurrection or 5G conspiracies? Logically, there is no difference in “wrongness.” One is mainstream, the other fringe, but both represent the same willingness to accept untruths as long as they fit into the narrative we crave.

Dogmatic beliefs are not harmless. They have seeped into our society, corroding critical thinking and paving the way for conspiracies to take root. When parents refuse life-saving vaccinations for their children because “God will take care of them,” this is not faith. It’s abuse. When people abandon science because it doesn’t align with their worldview, they open the door to chaos. We’ve normalized irrationality by allowing certain lies to stand unchallenged for centuries. Now, when trust in media and science erodes, is it any wonder that people turn to new dogmas for salvation?

These beliefs are multiplying: the earth is flat, vaccines cause autism, humans and dinosaurs coexisted, climate change is a hoax. They gain traction because we’ve created a society where belief outweighs truth, where questioning established narratives is seen as rebellious rather than rational. But let’s not forget that even these modern conspiracies trace their roots back to religion. “The earth is flat” echoes ancient religious cosmology. “Humans and dinosaurs coexisted” comes from creationist fantasies. It’s all the same pattern: a refusal to face reality and an insistence on clinging to comforting lies.


## How dogmatic beliefs empower Populists

Populism, thrives in an environment where dogmatic beliefs and a lack of trust in traditional truths. The emotional manipulation inherent in populist rhetoric mirrors the mechanisms of dogmatic belief systems, which thrive on simplicity and certainty. Just as dogmas offer comforting answers to life’s uncertainties, populist leaders craft narratives that appeal to deeply held fears and desires, casting “the people” as virtuous victims and “the elite” as corrupt oppressors. This framework preys on the same human instinct for binary thinking, leveraging the erosion of trust in institutions like media, science, the law and government to position themselves as the only source of truth.

The lack of trust in truths exacerbates the spread of populist ideologies by creating fertile ground for misinformation and conspiracy theories. In this void, people gravitate toward narratives that resonate emotionally, regardless of their factual basis. Populist leaders amplify these narratives, often framing themselves as the sole arbiters of authenticity in a world full of deceit. This dynamic mirrors the appeal of dogmatic belief systems, where adherents reject evidence-based reasoning in favor of emotionally satisfying myths. a

Populism also thrives by prioritizing the "popular" over the "principled," a hallmark of dogmatic thinking. Just as dogmatic beliefs resist challenges to their internal logic, populist movements dismiss inconvenient truths or principles that conflict with their agenda. This strategy is evident in the populist reliance on oversimplified narratives: complex societal issues like climate change or economic inequality are reduced to "us versus them" battles. Solutions are framed in binary terms, fostering division rather than collaboration. The rejection of nuance in favor of simplistic binaries aligns closely with the way dogmatic systems operate, where questioning is seen as betrayal.

Ultimately, populism, as redefined, uses the same mechanisms as dogmatic beliefs to enforce its dominance: fear, exclusion, and distrust.

## Conclusion

For centuries, religion provided answers to humanity’s greatest uncertainties, often filling the gaps in knowledge. Today, as trust in traditional sources of truth—science, journalism, and institutions—erodes, new dogmas arise to take their place. These beliefs, whether rooted in conspiracy theories or misinformation, thrive in an environment of fear and uncertainty. The case of vaccines and autism demonstrates how dangerous these dogmas can be when left unchecked. -->
