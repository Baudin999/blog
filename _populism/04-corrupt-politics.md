Politics, as a mechanism for governance and representation, is increasingly marred by corruption, broken promises, and exploitation of public trust. Across nations, examples abound of politicians prioritizing personal gain or special interests over the well-being of their constituents. This erosion of integrity, compounded by dubious funding and policy manipulation, reveals the systemic flaws that perpetuate public disillusionment and resentment.

## **Corruption at the Core**

Corruption scandals among politicians undermine faith in governance. Both the Netherlands and the United States have seen prominent figures jailed for their criminal actions, demonstrating that corruption transcends national boundaries:

1. **Jos van Rey (Netherlands):**  
   A former mayor and prominent member of the VVD, van Rey was convicted in 2016 for bribery, corruption, and election fraud. He funneled lucrative real estate contracts to his close associates, betraying the public trust he was sworn to uphold.

2. **Jack Abramoff (United States):**  
   A lobbyist and Republican political consultant, Abramoff was convicted in 2006 for bribery, fraud, and tax evasion. His schemes funneled millions of dollars into influencing lawmakers and exploiting Native American tribes seeking casino licenses.

3. **Richard de Mos (Netherlands):**  
   Once hailed as a populist champion, de Mos was arrested and later convicted for accepting bribes and facilitating illegal permits in exchange for political favors during his tenure as a Hague city councilor.

4. **Rod Blagojevich (United States):**  
   The former governor of Illinois was sentenced to 14 years in prison for attempting to sell Barack Obama’s vacated Senate seat. His blatant abuse of power shocked even the notoriously corrupt political scene of Illinois.

## **Bought and Paid For**

Corruption doesn’t always lead to jail. Many politicians secure lucrative board positions in industries they once regulated, casting doubt on the independence of their public service. 

1. **Neelie Kroes (Netherlands):**  
   The former European Commissioner for Competition, Kroes joined Uber’s advisory board shortly after her tenure, sparking outrage over potential conflicts of interest related to EU regulations.

2. **Dick Cheney (United States):**  
   Before and after his vice presidency, Cheney held significant roles at Halliburton, a major defense contractor, which benefited enormously from the Iraq War—a conflict he helped advocate for while in office.

3. **Gerrit Zalm (Netherlands):**  
   The former Dutch Minister of Finance joined ABN AMRO's board, raising eyebrows about the coziness between government regulators and banking institutions he had once overseen.

4. **Henry Paulson (United States):**  
   The former U.S. Treasury Secretary, Paulson was the CEO of Goldman Sachs prior to his government role. After orchestrating bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis, he returned to the financial sector, reinforcing the image of a revolving door between Wall Street and Washington.

## **Dubious Funding and Its Policy Impact**

Political funding often comes with strings attached, influencing policy in ways that benefit donors over the public.

1. **Geert Wilders (Netherlands):**  
   Wilders, the far-right PVV leader, has received substantial funding from American conservative donors. This financial backing aligns with his anti-Islamic rhetoric, raising questions about the influence of foreign interests on Dutch politics.

2. **Thierry Baudet (Netherlands):**  
   Baudet, leader of the populist FvD, has been linked to questionable funding sources, including undisclosed donations. His policies and messaging often align with international right-wing narratives, suggesting external influence.

3. **The Koch Brothers (United States):**  
   Billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch have funneled millions into American politics, backing candidates who oppose climate regulations and labor protections, prioritizing their corporate interests over environmental and worker concerns.

4. **The NRA and Gun Policy (United States):**  
   The National Rifle Association has spent millions funding pro-gun candidates, influencing policies that consistently block gun control measures despite widespread public support for reform.

## **Taking Power Away from the People**

The consolidation of corporate and governmental power has systematically stripped citizens of agency, creating a system that prioritizes profits over public welfare.

1. **Privatization:**  
   In both the Netherlands and the United States, essential public services like healthcare, transportation, and energy have been privatized, often resulting in higher costs and poorer quality for consumers. Dutch rail privatization has led to reduced services and delays, while in the U.S., privatized prisons incentivize incarceration over rehabilitation.

2. **Corporate Personhood:**  
   The legal status of corporations as "people," reinforced by rulings like *Citizens United v. FEC* in the U.S., has allowed unlimited corporate spending in elections, drowning out the voices of ordinary voters.

3. **Neoliberalism:**  
   The rise of neoliberal policies, championed by politicians in both nations, has prioritized deregulation, tax cuts for the wealthy, and austerity measures, exacerbating income inequality and undermining social safety nets.

## **Fearmongering as a Tool of Control**

Politicians often resort to fearmongering to maintain power, framing crises in ways that divide and distract the populace:

1. **Climate Change:**  
   In the U.S., Republican leaders have used fear of economic collapse to oppose environmental regulations, claiming climate action will destroy jobs. In the Netherlands, populists like Baudet dismiss climate change as a hoax, stoking fears about government overreach.

2. **Border Crisis:**  
   In the U.S., Donald Trump’s rhetoric about a "border crisis" exaggerated threats posed by immigrants, using fear to justify harsh policies like family separations. Similarly, Wilders in the Netherlands has capitalized on fears of cultural erosion by opposing immigration from Muslim-majority countries.

3. **Public Health Crises:**  
   Politicians have used health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, to stoke fear for political gain. In some cases, leaders exaggerated the dangers to justify authoritarian policies or consolidate power, while others downplayed the risks to fuel distrust in science and public health institutions. This dual approach created divisions and uncertainty, leaving populations vulnerable to both misinformation and public unrest.

4. **Fear of Terror and Loss of Privacy:**   
    Politicians have often invoked the fear of terrorism to justify sweeping surveillance measures, leading to the erosion of privacy and civil liberties. In the United States, the Patriot Act, passed shortly after the 9/11 attacks, vastly expanded government surveillance powers. Under its provisions, agencies could collect phone records, monitor internet activity, and conduct warrantless searches, all in the name of preventing terrorism. While these measures were framed as necessary for national security, they also enabled widespread surveillance of ordinary citizens, raising serious concerns about government overreach.

    Similarly, in the Netherlands, the Sleepwet (literally "dragnet law"), officially known as the Intelligence and Security Services Act 2017, allowed Dutch intelligence agencies to intercept bulk internet traffic, including communications of people not directly under suspicion. Proponents argued that the law was essential to combat terrorism and cyber threats, but critics highlighted its potential for mass surveillance and abuse. A 2018 referendum on the law revealed significant public concern, though the government ultimately implemented it with minor adjustments. Both cases illustrate how fear of terror can be exploited to expand state surveillance, eroding privacy under the guise of security.

While real concerns about terrorism and security do exist, these issues are rarely handled with the rationality and transparency they deserve. Instead, they are often exploited to justify government overreach, with policies that prioritize control over citizens rather than addressing root causes. Corporate interests frequently play a significant role in shaping these decisions. In the United States, for instance, companies specializing in surveillance technologies and data analytics have reaped enormous profits from government contracts under the guise of national security. Similarly, in the Netherlands, tech firms and internet service providers have benefited from the infrastructure required to implement mass surveillance laws like the Sleepwet. These alliances between government and corporations blur the line between public safety and private profit, further eroding public trust and raising questions about whose interests are truly being served.

The erosion of privacy through expanded surveillance policies has not only enriched corporations but also provided a powerful tool for influencing democratic processes, as evidenced by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, harvested personal data from millions of Facebook users without their explicit consent. This data, combined with advanced psychographic profiling, was used to create hyper-targeted political advertisements designed to manipulate voter behavior in elections such as the 2016 U.S. presidential race and the Brexit referendum.

The scandal revealed how the vast amounts of data collected under the guise of improving security or providing better services could be weaponized to undermine democratic principles. Surveillance-driven policies, coupled with data-hungry corporations, create an ecosystem where the intimate details of citizens’ lives are exploited to shape opinions and drive political agendas. Governments, complicit in this arrangement, often turn a blind eye to such practices, as the very tools used to protect "national security" are now repurposed to maintain political power. This convergence of surveillance, corporate interests, and political manipulation marks a dangerous precedent, where privacy is sacrificed not for safety, but for control and influence.


## **Conclusion**

The pervasive climate of fear has fractured societies, creating deep divisions that populists and demagogues readily exploit. When trust in institutions crumbles, charismatic leaders emerge, not to heal but to manipulate, offering *panem et circenses*—bread and circuses—as a distraction from systemic decay. These leaders thrive by stoking fear, providing false enemies, and fostering distrust, further alienating the populace from institutions that were meant to protect and serve them.

Corruption and opaque funding further erode integrity, shifting politicians' allegiances from the public good to corporate interests or foreign influences. Policies that should safeguard citizens instead serve the highest bidder, as political donations and revolving doors between government and industry quietly reshape governance to benefit a select few. 

In this cycle of fear and corruption, it is the people who ultimately bear the cost. Divided and disillusioned, they are left to grapple with worsening inequality, deteriorating public services, and a political system that no longer seems to work for them. Without a concerted effort to restore transparency, accountability, and trust, the cycle will persist, deepening the suffering of the very citizens democracy was designed to empower.

## VVD example

Over the past two decades, several members of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) in the Netherlands have faced legal issues or were dismissed due to misconduct. Notable cases include:

1. **Ton Hooijmaijers (2013):** The former Provincial Executive of North Holland was convicted of bribery, money laundering, and forgery. He received a prison sentence for accepting bribes from project developers in exchange for favorable decisions. 

2. **Patricia Remak (2008):** A former Member of Parliament and Provincial States member, Remak was convicted of benefit fraud. She unlawfully received unemployment benefits while holding paid positions, leading to a prison sentence and community service. 

3. **Johan Houwers (2015):** The former MP was convicted of mortgage fraud. He falsified income information to obtain a mortgage, resulting in a fine and his resignation from Parliament. 

4. **Jos van Rey (2016):** The former senator and mayor was convicted of corruption, including bribery and leaking confidential information. He received a prison sentence and was fined for his actions. 

5. **Mark Verheijen (2015):** The MP resigned following allegations of improper expense claims during his tenure as a provincial executive. Although not criminally charged, the controversy led to his departure from Parliament.

These cases highlight instances where VVD politicians faced legal consequences or were dismissed due to misconduct over the past two decades.

### Question

The question I want to pose is the following:

*Why whould anyone vote for a party which clearly is not good at selecting individuals who act honorably?*
