title: "Establishing Independent Oversight through Professional Governance Councils"
chapter: 10
order: 10
---

To further strengthen accountability and ensure that day-to-day operations across various sectors are managed by experienced professionals, we propose the establishment of **Independent Oversight Bodies**, hereafter referred to as **Professional Governance Councils** (PGCs). These councils will function alongside traditional political structures, providing specialized oversight and regulation within their respective domains.

**Introduction to Professional Governance Councils**

- **Parallel Electoral System**: In addition to general political elections, we will hold elections specifically for PGCs every four years.
- **Electing Top Professionals**: Citizens will elect eligible professionals from various fields—such as business leaders, academics, scientists, and industry experts—who wish to temporarily serve in public oversight roles.
- **Self Signup**: Professionals will be able to make themselves eligible, the companies they work for are not allowed to fire them. Their role in the PGC will not take more than 50% of their time.
- **Purpose of PGCs**: These councils will act as independent regulatory bodies, overseeing the implementation of policies and ensuring compliance within their respective sectors.

**Structure and Function of the Councils**

- **Collaborative Leadership**: The top five elected professionals in each council will share equal authority and responsibility, fostering a collaborative environment that encourages diverse perspectives and healthy competition of ideas.
- **Division of Roles**: While politicians and political parties will continue to create policies and laws, the PGCs will focus on the practical oversight and management of sectors such as healthcare, education, finance, media, and technology.
- **Expert Management**: By leveraging the expertise of seasoned professionals, PGCs ensure that sectors are managed efficiently, ethically, and in alignment with the nation's best interests. They are responsible for reducing waste and increasing efficiency.

**Judicial Oversight within the Councils**

- **Dedicated Justices**: Each PGC will have dedicated justices who serve as gatekeepers for legal disputes and infractions within the sector. It is not the purpose to spend millions on legal fees. These will be provided free of charge.
- **Dispute Resolution**: These justices will handle disputes promptly, determining whether issues should proceed to trial or be resolved through mediation or other appropriate means.
- **Enforcement of Regulations**: Infractions are addressed according to the law, with consequences ranging from legal penalties to expulsion from the sector, ensuring accountability and adherence to ethical standards.

**Benefits of Professional Governance Councils**

- **Enhanced Oversight**: PGCs provide specialized oversight by professionals with direct experience and knowledge, leading to more effective regulation and management.
- **Balanced Governance**: This system maintains a clear separation between policy-making by politicians and the practical oversight by industry experts, reducing the risk of political interference in technical matters.
- **Public Trust**: Electing respected professionals to oversight roles increases transparency and trust in regulatory bodies, as these individuals are accountable directly to the electorate.
- **Diverse Perspectives**: Equal power among the top five council members ensures a range of viewpoints are considered in decision-making processes, promoting well-rounded and robust oversight.

**Election Process**

- **Regular Elections**: PGC elections will occur every four years, offsetting the general elections with two years to encourage widespread participation.
- **Eligibility Criteria**: Candidates must demonstrate substantial experience and a record of ethical conduct in their professional fields.
- **Collaborative Mandate**: Elected council members are required to work together, with equal authority, to prevent dominance by a single viewpoint and to foster collaborative solutions.

**Conclusion**

The creation of Professional Governance Councils introduces a new layer of expert oversight in our governance structure. By involving accomplished professionals in the regulatory process, we bridge the gap between legislation and implementation. This system ensures that policies are not only sound in theory but are also effectively executed in practice. Through the PGCs, we harness the knowledge and experience of our nation's best minds to serve the public interest, reinforcing accountability, efficiency, and trust in our institutions.
