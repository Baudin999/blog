Political integrity is fundamental to the health of a democracy. False claims and deceptive practices are deliberate actions that corrode public trust and weaken democratic institutions. To restore confidence in our governance, we must implement stringent reforms that hold not only individual politicians but entire political parties accountable for dishonesty.

**Reforms**

- **Implement a Three-Strike Rule Affecting Entire Political Parties**
  - **Policy**: If a politician consciously makes three verified false statements, they are permanently disqualified from holding any public office. Furthermore, their political party is required to abstain from participating in the next two election cycles, unable to field any candidates.
  
- **Prohibit Lucrative Post-Office Employment for High-Level Politicians**
  - **Policy**: Politicians who have served at the highest levels are barred from accepting positions in private sectors. They are allowed to work as teachers, speakers and authors. They can use their experience and knowledge to better society.
  
- **Fix Politicians' Income and Freeze Personal Assets**
  - **Policy**: Establish a standardized salary for politicians, disallowing any additional income from outside sources during and after their tenure. Personal assets are frozen throughout their time in office.
  
- **Provide Housing and a Communal Bank Account**
  - **Policy**: Politicians receive government-provided housing and utilize a communal bank account monitored for transparency and accountability. This continues even after office. If you have served your country, the country will provide.

**Why These Reforms Work**

- **Enforces Strict Accountability and Truthfulness**
  - **Collective Responsibility**: By imposing consequences on entire political parties, there is a powerful incentive for parties to ensure their members uphold the highest standards of honesty.
  - **Zero Tolerance for Misinformation**: Knowing that the actions of one individual can sideline the whole party, there is increased vigilance against spreading falsehoods.
  
- **Eliminates Conflicts of Interest**
  - **Post-Service Restrictions**: Prohibiting lucrative post-office careers prevents politicians from making decisions that favor potential future employers over the public interest.
  - **Dedication to Public Service**: Fixed incomes and frozen assets ensure politicians focus on their duties rather than personal financial gain.
  
- **Enhances Transparency and Public Trust**
  - **Financial Oversight**: Government-provided housing and communal bank accounts reduce opportunities for financial misconduct and increase transparency.
  - **Restored Confidence**: Visible adherence to strict ethical standards by both politicians and their parties rebuilds faith in leadership and institutions.
  
- **Prevents Abuse of Power**
  - **Limits Influence Peddling**: Restrictions on post-office employment prevent the exploitation of insider knowledge and connections for personal gain.
  - **Encourages Ethical Party Culture**: Parties are compelled to foster a culture of integrity to avoid collective punishment.
  
- **Strengthens Democratic Processes**
  - **Disqualification of Dishonest Actors**: Removing politicians and parties that engage in deceit upholds the integrity of elections and governance.
  - **Promotes Ethical Leadership**: Parties are incentivized to select candidates of high moral standing, knowing the severe repercussions of dishonesty.
  
- **Deters Systemic Corruption**
  - **Institutional Accountability**: Holding entire parties accountable discourages systemic corruption and promotes internal regulation.
  - **Public Empowerment**: Citizens regain trust in the political system when they see tangible measures taken against dishonesty.

By implementing these reforms, we address the root causes of corruption and the erosion of democracy. Holding both individual politicians and their parties accountable for falsehoods realigns public service with its true purpose: serving the people with honesty and integrity. These measures are essential steps toward restoring trust in governance and ensuring a robust, functioning democracy.

## Upholding Accountability: Eliminating Special Privileges to Strengthen Democracy

No institution—whether religious organizations or corporations—should stand above the law or wield undue influence over politics. To ensure integrity, we must enforce strict regulations that hold all entities accountable. By holding religious organizations responsible under the law, removing their tax-exempt status, revoking corporate personhood to eliminate excessive money in politics, and enforcing higher standards for media conduct, we reinforce the foundations of justice and democratic participation.

**Reforms**

- **Hold Religious Organizations Accountable and Remove Tax Exemptions**
  - **Policy**: Apply all laws uniformly to religious institutions, eliminating their eligibility for tax-exempt status.
  - **Action**: Amend tax codes to ensure that religious organizations pay taxes like any other entity and are subject to the same legal obligations and scrutiny.

- **Abolish Corporate Personhood to Remove Money from Politics**
  - **Policy**: Revoke the legal status of corporations as "persons," thereby restricting their ability to influence politics through financial contributions.
  - **Action**: Enact legislation or constitutional amendments to eliminate corporate personhood, prohibiting corporations from making political donations or engaging in political lobbying.

- **Implement Strict Regulations for Media Organizations**
  - **Policy**: Enforce standards requiring media outlets to clearly distinguish between factual reporting and opinion pieces.
  - **Action**: Establish an independent regulatory body to oversee media practices, ensuring adherence to journalistic ethics and accuracy.
  - **Action**: The same entity cannot both provide news and sensation. It is either one or the other.
  - **Action**: News entities are 100% publicly funded by individual donations with a maximum of $100 per month, this is supplemented by government funding. Governments are not allowed to lower their funding for not corporate reasons.

- **Penalize the Dissemination of Deliberate Misinformation**
  - **Policy**: Impose penalties on media organizations and individuals that intentionally spread false information.
  - **Action**: Implement legal consequences, including fines and license revocations, for violations of media integrity standards.
  - **Action**: Create an oversight body which tests the intentionality of a claim, the bar for proof must be high.

**Why These Reforms Work**

- **Ensures Fair Contribution and Legal Compliance**
  - **Equal Taxation**: By removing tax exemptions, religious organizations contribute their fair share to public services, promoting financial equity.
  - **Uniform Legal Standards**: Holding religious institutions to the same laws prevents them from circumventing regulations, protecting individuals from potential abuse and exploitation.

- **Reduces Undue Influence in Politics**
  - **Eliminating Corporate Personhood**: Revoking corporations' legal status as persons removes their ability to flood the political system with money, reducing corruption and the sway of special interests.
  - **Restores Democratic Processes**: Limiting corporate influence ensures that policies reflect the will of the people rather than the agendas of powerful entities.

- **Enhances Media Credibility and Public Trust**
  - **Clear Distinction Between Fact and Opinion**: Requiring media to differentiate between news and commentary enables the public to make informed decisions based on accurate information.
  - **Accountability in Reporting**: Oversight ensures media outlets adhere to ethical standards, curbing the spread of misinformation and rebuilding trust.

- **Promotes Informed Public Discourse**
  - **Reduces Sensationalism**: Penalizing deliberate misinformation discourages media from employing tactics that mislead or polarize the public.
  - **Supports Democratic Engagement**: An informed electorate is essential for a healthy democracy; accurate media reporting is crucial for facilitating meaningful participation.

- **Reinforces the Rule of Law and Equality**
  - **Consistent Enforcement**: Holding all institutions accountable reinforces the principle that no one is above the law, strengthening the legal system's credibility.
  - **Public Confidence**: When justice is applied equally, citizens are more likely to trust and engage positively with societal structures, fostering a more cohesive society.
