**Notes:**

- **Mark Verheijen (VVD, 2015):** Former MP who resigned after allegations of fraudulent expense claims during his time as a provincial executive. He was not criminally charged but left his position under a cloud of dishonor.

- **Co Verdaas (PvdA, 2013):** Former State Secretary for Agriculture who resigned due to irregularities in his expense claims related to travel. His resignation was considered a dishonorable discharge.

- **Robin Linschoten (VVD, 2017):** Former State Secretary convicted of tax fraud for failing to provide accurate tax returns for his consultancy firm.

- **Halbe Zijlstra (VVD, 2018):** Former Minister of Foreign Affairs who resigned after admitting he lied about attending a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. His resignation was deemed dishonorable.

- **Mark Harbers (VVD, 2019):** Former State Secretary for Justice and Security who resigned after a report under his watch failed to disclose serious crimes committed by asylum seekers. His departure was considered a dishonorable discharge.

- **Pieter Omtzigt (CDA, 2019):** Although not convicted of any crime, he faced internal party conflicts and allegations related to his conduct during the child welfare fraud scandal investigations. He eventually left the CDA but was not officially dishonorably discharged.

**Explanation:**

- The term **"oneervol ontslagen"** translates to "dishonorably discharged" and is used when an official is forced to leave their position due to misconduct or actions deemed inappropriate, even if they are not legally convicted of a crime.

- In Dutch politics, it is relatively rare for politicians to be officially labeled as dishonorably discharged. Often, they resign under pressure or due to scandals, which is informally considered a dishonorable exit.

- The above list includes politicians who left their positions under circumstances that align with the notion of being dishonorably discharged, either due to misconduct, scandals, or loss of trust.

## Case study: Vaccines cause autism

The belief that vaccines cause autism traces back to a 1998 study published in *The Lancet* by Andrew Wakefield, a British doctor. The study claimed to identify a link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism in children. However, it later emerged that Wakefield had serious conflicts of interest: he was being paid by lawyers who were suing vaccine manufacturers and had filed a patent for an alternative vaccine. These motivations led him to falsify data and manipulate the study to align with his claims. His paper included only 12 children—an extremely small and statistically insignificant sample size—and was retracted by *The Lancet* in 2010 after an investigation exposed its fraudulent nature.

The paper ignited a firestorm. Media coverage amplified Wakefield’s claims, often presenting them uncritically. Parents, concerned for their children's safety, began to delay or refuse vaccinations, leading to declining immunization rates. Celebrities like Jenny McCarthy championed the anti-vaccine cause, lending it a public platform. The medical community, however, was quick to respond: numerous large-scale studies involving hundreds of thousands of children found no link between vaccines and autism. Despite this, the damage was done—vaccination rates in some areas plummeted, and diseases like measles, previously under control, began resurging globally.

Wakefield’s claims were utterly discredited. Investigations revealed that he had falsified data, manipulated case histories, and misrepresented facts. For example, some of the children in his study had already shown signs of autism before receiving the vaccine, contradicting his conclusions. Wakefield was stripped of his medical license, and his work is now regarded as one of the most egregious cases of scientific fraud in modern history. Universities and medical schools frequently use this case as a cautionary tale, teaching future scientists and doctors about the ethical responsibilities of researchers and the dangers of allowing personal interests to interfere with scientific integrity.

Despite overwhelming evidence debunking the vaccine-autism link, the belief persists among certain groups, including some highly educated, left-leaning parents. These individuals often prioritize natural living and holistic health, leading to distrust of pharmaceutical companies and modern medicine. The internet has amplified this skepticism, creating echo chambers where misinformation thrives. For many, this belief is less about evidence and more about identity—rejecting vaccines aligns with broader worldviews about personal autonomy, distrust of corporations, and protecting children from perceived harm. 

This case study highlights the complexity of combating misinformation: intelligence and education do not necessarily immunize individuals against believing falsehoods when those beliefs resonate with their values.

## Generalization and Trends

This document is sounds incredibly generalizing and for a piece deliberately trying to call out populism and binary equation of complex topics this might seem incredibly suspicious if not outright malevolent. In this chapter I want to explain what I am doing and how it is nuanced.

After World War II, the world united and rebuild. This triggered hope and collaboration. In these decades the spirit which first was voiced during the enlightenment truly shone like a bright guiding star. The sixties, saw a rise in equality and a unification. Civil Rights prevailed while suffering terrible losses. Anti war movements fought against global power struggles in Korea, Vietnam, Dutch Indies, South America and Israel. Even though politicians were flirting with social ideas like Universal Basic Income and there was a rise in Unions, something started to brew within *the powers that be*.

Reagan and Thatcher were the result of careful planning and structured manipulation. Conservative ideas veiled a backlash to the growing power of the common man. I want to clarify, this is not a Marxist idea of the common man, no, this is the idea that everyone deserves to be happy, healthy and in charge of their own life. Neoliberalism was an answer, carefully planned and brilliantly executed over a period spanning decades. 

This Neoliberal ideology is at the root of my critique and it has permeated both the left and the right of the political spectrum. What this document describes is the trends which started with the Neoliberal ideology after WWII and ends with our current state of populist leaders, both political, social and entrepreneurial. 

The reason why I feel comfortable being so direct and generalizing is that the trend is not changing. It is getting worse, which means that counter weights are either not strong enough or not motivated enough. The result being that they are ineffective. My thesis takes this into account and dismisses ineffective attempts at resisting. For example:

* There are a lot of amazing journalists, still reporting, doing their due diligence and trying to make a difference. They are just being overshadowed by bad faith actors in this same space. If I were to give them the same amount of words in this writing, I would fall into the trap of balancing the arguments, giving the bad faith actors ammunition to day "see? It is not so bad." While, in fact, it *is* so bad.
* There are a lot of well meaning politicians. For example, almost no one knows that the Dutch party the SP uses the money the politicians earn and take a part of that to fund their initiatives. They are truly generous and do not succumb to corruption as much as other parties. But again, they are ineffective. To elevate them to the same amount of words as, for example the VVD would be ingenuous and conflate the premise.
* Religion has done a lot for society, from great works of art and music to uniting communities and increasing solidarity. The goal of this article is not to undermine the good religions have done, it is to show that critical thinking is not something religions welcome and stimulate. Reason and logic need to be valued, communities need to be fostered, religions need to take responsibility for their part in the problem. 

The last thing I want to address is the role of podcasts and comedy shows. Jon Stewart was voted most trust worthy source of news. He never owned this responsibility. He did however tried to hold the media accountable but not in an effective way. Joe Rogan always states that he "is just talking to people", but he forgets to say that there is a trend of who comes on the podcast, the topics he likes to discuss and the influence he has. Both of these example try to minimize their contributions to the chaos and duck their responsibilities. This is why their are ineffective and a part of the problem. They try to get themselves out of the journalistic responsibility by saying "I am just a comedian" and "I just have conversations" even though they know their influence is tremendous and with great power comes great responsibility. 

This writing tries to show the weaknesses of out current society but it also tries to formulate real achievable policies to enact meaningful change. It stays away from details like "Carbon emissions" or "gun regulation laws" because those are symptoms of a corrupt system and red herrings. The policies proposed here are to create a stable society in which all of these problems can be tackled with reason, logic and empathy. Change the system instead of the symptom.
