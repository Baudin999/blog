**Notes:**

- **Mark Verheijen (VVD, 2015):** Former MP who resigned after allegations of fraudulent expense claims during his time as a provincial executive. He was not criminally charged but left his position under a cloud of dishonor.

- **Co Verdaas (PvdA, 2013):** Former State Secretary for Agriculture who resigned due to irregularities in his expense claims related to travel. His resignation was considered a dishonorable discharge.

- **Robin Linschoten (VVD, 2017):** Former State Secretary convicted of tax fraud for failing to provide accurate tax returns for his consultancy firm.

- **Halbe Zijlstra (VVD, 2018):** Former Minister of Foreign Affairs who resigned after admitting he lied about attending a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. His resignation was deemed dishonorable.

- **Mark Harbers (VVD, 2019):** Former State Secretary for Justice and Security who resigned after a report under his watch failed to disclose serious crimes committed by asylum seekers. His departure was considered a dishonorable discharge.

- **Pieter Omtzigt (CDA, 2019):** Although not convicted of any crime, he faced internal party conflicts and allegations related to his conduct during the child welfare fraud scandal investigations. He eventually left the CDA but was not officially dishonorably discharged.

**Explanation:**

- The term **"oneervol ontslagen"** translates to "dishonorably discharged" and is used when an official is forced to leave their position due to misconduct or actions deemed inappropriate, even if they are not legally convicted of a crime.

- In Dutch politics, it is relatively rare for politicians to be officially labeled as dishonorably discharged. Often, they resign under pressure or due to scandals, which is informally considered a dishonorable exit.

- The above list includes politicians who left their positions under circumstances that align with the notion of being dishonorably discharged, either due to misconduct, scandals, or loss of trust.
