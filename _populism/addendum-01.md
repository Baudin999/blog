**Notes:**

- **Mark Verheijen (VVD, 2015):** Former MP who resigned after allegations of fraudulent expense claims during his time as a provincial executive. He was not criminally charged but left his position under a cloud of dishonor.

- **Co Verdaas (PvdA, 2013):** Former State Secretary for Agriculture who resigned due to irregularities in his expense claims related to travel. His resignation was considered a dishonorable discharge.

- **Robin Linschoten (VVD, 2017):** Former State Secretary convicted of tax fraud for failing to provide accurate tax returns for his consultancy firm.

- **Halbe Zijlstra (VVD, 2018):** Former Minister of Foreign Affairs who resigned after admitting he lied about attending a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. His resignation was deemed dishonorable.

- **Mark Harbers (VVD, 2019):** Former State Secretary for Justice and Security who resigned after a report under his watch failed to disclose serious crimes committed by asylum seekers. His departure was considered a dishonorable discharge.

- **Pieter Omtzigt (CDA, 2019):** Although not convicted of any crime, he faced internal party conflicts and allegations related to his conduct during the child welfare fraud scandal investigations. He eventually left the CDA but was not officially dishonorably discharged.

**Explanation:**

- The term **"oneervol ontslagen"** translates to "dishonorably discharged" and is used when an official is forced to leave their position due to misconduct or actions deemed inappropriate, even if they are not legally convicted of a crime.

- In Dutch politics, it is relatively rare for politicians to be officially labeled as dishonorably discharged. Often, they resign under pressure or due to scandals, which is informally considered a dishonorable exit.

- The above list includes politicians who left their positions under circumstances that align with the notion of being dishonorably discharged, either due to misconduct, scandals, or loss of trust.

## Case study: Vaccines cause autism

The belief that vaccines cause autism traces back to a 1998 study published in *The Lancet* by Andrew Wakefield, a British doctor. The study claimed to identify a link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism in children. However, it later emerged that Wakefield had serious conflicts of interest: he was being paid by lawyers who were suing vaccine manufacturers and had filed a patent for an alternative vaccine. These motivations led him to falsify data and manipulate the study to align with his claims. His paper included only 12 children—an extremely small and statistically insignificant sample size—and was retracted by *The Lancet* in 2010 after an investigation exposed its fraudulent nature.

The paper ignited a firestorm. Media coverage amplified Wakefield’s claims, often presenting them uncritically. Parents, concerned for their children's safety, began to delay or refuse vaccinations, leading to declining immunization rates. Celebrities like Jenny McCarthy championed the anti-vaccine cause, lending it a public platform. The medical community, however, was quick to respond: numerous large-scale studies involving hundreds of thousands of children found no link between vaccines and autism. Despite this, the damage was done—vaccination rates in some areas plummeted, and diseases like measles, previously under control, began resurging globally.

Wakefield’s claims were utterly discredited. Investigations revealed that he had falsified data, manipulated case histories, and misrepresented facts. For example, some of the children in his study had already shown signs of autism before receiving the vaccine, contradicting his conclusions. Wakefield was stripped of his medical license, and his work is now regarded as one of the most egregious cases of scientific fraud in modern history. Universities and medical schools frequently use this case as a cautionary tale, teaching future scientists and doctors about the ethical responsibilities of researchers and the dangers of allowing personal interests to interfere with scientific integrity.

Despite overwhelming evidence debunking the vaccine-autism link, the belief persists among certain groups, including some highly educated, left-leaning parents. These individuals often prioritize natural living and holistic health, leading to distrust of pharmaceutical companies and modern medicine. The internet has amplified this skepticism, creating echo chambers where misinformation thrives. For many, this belief is less about evidence and more about identity—rejecting vaccines aligns with broader worldviews about personal autonomy, distrust of corporations, and protecting children from perceived harm. 

This case study highlights the complexity of combating misinformation: intelligence and education do not necessarily immunize individuals against believing falsehoods when those beliefs resonate with their values.
