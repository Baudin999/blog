To tackle the root causes of societal mistrust and inequality, we must redefine economic security by guaranteeing access to essential goods and services. Shifting from monetary aid to providing fundamental necessities ensures that no one goes hungry or lacks basic utilities, fostering a foundation for a healthier and more equitable society.

To be extremely blunt, if a parent suffers from an addiction, let's say a gambling addiction. We need to find a fair way for the children to eat healthy and have the simple necessities of life like housing, heating, electricity and education. These are the foundations on which they will build a successful, self sustaining life.

**Reforms**

- **Implement Universal Basic Provision of Essential Foods**
  - Provide free access to vegetables, fruits, grains, rice, potatoes, and pasta for all citizens.

- **Tax Unhealthy Foods and Impose High Tariffs**
  - Medium tax meat and fish.
  - Processed unhealthy foods to discourage consumption.
  - Impose high tariffs on imports and exports of food to promote local consumption and reduce reliance on global trade. This also promotes less waste as the food will be more likely to be grown locally.

- **Reclaim and Nationalize Essential Services**
  - Reverse the privatization of healthcare, railroads, and other critical infrastructure.
  - Make utilities like internet access, water, and electricity free and publicly managed.
  - Transition fully from gas and coal
  - Invest in Nuclear energy as a backup for solar
  - Do not invest in H2
  - Run these nationalized services like companies, they should be self sustaining.

- **Cease Collection of Personal Data**
  - Prohibit corporations and government entities from collecting and exploiting individual data.

**Why These Reforms Work**

- **Ensures Basic Nutritional Needs**
  - **Universal Access to Staples**: Providing essential foods for free eliminates hunger and malnutrition, improving public health and productivity.
  - **Economic Relief**: Reduces financial strain on households, allowing funds to be allocated to other necessities.

- **Promotes Healthier Lifestyles**
  - **Discourages Unhealthy Consumption**: Taxing unhealthy foods lowers their affordability and consumption, leading to better health outcomes and less healthcare costs.
  - **Supports Sustainable Practices**: High tariffs encourage local farming and reduce environmental impact from transportation while still giving access to these products.

- **Restores Public Control and Accountability**
  - **Equal Access to Services**: Nationalizing essential services ensures equal availability regardless of income, reducing disparities.
  - **Improved Service Quality**: Public management focuses on service over profit, enhancing reliability and customer satisfaction.

- **Protects Individual Privacy**
  - **Prevents Data Exploitation**: Banning data collection safeguards citizens from surveillance and manipulation.
  - **Builds Trust**: Enhances confidence in institutions when privacy is respected and protected.

- **Strengthens Local Economies**
  - **Encourages Domestic Production**: Reducing imports stimulates local industries and job creation.
  - **Reduces Economic Inequality**: Access to free utilities and services diminishes the wealth gap by lifting the lowest economic strata.

By implementing these reforms, we establish an economic system that prioritizes the well-being of all citizens. Ensuring access to essential goods and services lays the groundwork for a more unified and trusting society, dismantling the foundations upon which divisiveness and populism thrive.

Another way to look at this is: Competition is great! A free market works, but only if the product or the service can distinguish itself and differentiate. For example, I get the same electricity, regardless of who sends me the invoice.
