working_experience:
  - job_title: Technical Director
    company: Artificial Core
    date: 2023 --
    location: Home, Netherlands
    responsibilities:
      - As a Technical Director I am helping the development of an MMO RPG called Corepunk. Creating an MMO 
        has focused all of my skills. Finding and hiring the right people, refactoring a legacy code-base and 
        helping the stakeholders make decisions like "which e-commerce platform should we use?"
      - Exploring new technologies and ways to solve solutions. Creating a MMO RPG is hard. It takes a lot
        of technical trial and error to come up with a way to have hundreds, if not thousands, of players 
        walking in the same shared world, enjoying the same shared content and having them carve their own
        place to enjoy and immerse themselves. As a technical director I have explored all kinds of game 
        servers and custom wrote at least three prototypes in C#, Rust and Go, in search of that novel server
        which can host a lot of players and still be extremely responsive.

about_me: 
  - Currently, I am the Technical Fellow of Essent. I help Essent realize its ambition of becoming a tech company by picking up the harder architectural problems. I also speak at conferences and write about our progress as a tech company. As a System Engineer I was technically responsible for about ninety developers spread over ten teams, divided into two domains, Personalization and Data & Analytics. I personally envisioned, designed and guided the teams to realize our own Customer Data Platform with personalized marketing. As a Technical Fellow I am trying to scale everything I've learned as a System Engineer, about helping an organisation change, to the entirety of Essent.
  - I have also guided Essent towards an amalgamation of a Data Mesh architecture and Gartner's Composable Enterprise. I am convinced that a Data Mesh architecture will help us realize our AI ambitions, while a Composable Enterprise will help us achieve development quality and speed. Essent was a traditional enterprise. I call these types or enterprises, "SAP oriented organisations". Through patience and by inspiring people I have managed to turn our organisation towards a Domain/Product oriented organisation. I have built teams to support our new vision and I have guided these teams towards success.
  - It is important to work with and towards your passions. My passions are reflected in my work; I want to create, inspire and guide the next generations of developers to find their passion and create great software. My philosophy is that an engineer should be great at what they do and an organisation is only great when they enable their employees to be successful.

  - title: Working on ZDragon
    description: I have always felt like documentation is not taken seriously. Except for a scale-up in the midst of rapid market expansion, a software developer needs to write code as if they themselves are going to maintain it in five years time. ZDragon helps with this documentation and is a passion project I am working on. It is a new programming language with a lexer, parser and a set of transpilers which transpile the code you write to a beautiful document.
  - title: Record Music
    description: I have always had a passion for music and have always been semi active in recording music. These day I am no longer a studio musician but I record my own songs from my own basement and try to play as many instruments as I can.
