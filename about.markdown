Hey there! I'm Carlos Kelkboom, a coder, creator, and – if you ask my kids – a pro-level dad joke teller.

## A Bit About Me 🧑🏻

- **Relationship Status**: Happily married (I know, right? 🎉) and blessed with kids.
  
- **Coding Journey**: Over two decades, I've had my fingers dancing on the keyboard, translating thoughts into code. That's right, I've seen floppy disks, and I've survived them.
  
- **Music & Writing**: When I'm not coding, you might find me making sweet melodies or diving deep into the world of novels. I write articles too, so expect to see some profound thoughts and occasional ramblings.

- **Hobbies Galore**: From coaching junior basketball (🏀 Go Wildcats!) to playing padel (nope, not a typo), I keep myself busy. And did I mention computer games? Yep, they're a big part of the list too.

## Professional Life 🖥️

Right now, I'm exploring the expansive universe of [Corepunk](https://corepunk.com/en/), an MMORPG, in the role of Technical Director. No matter how hard life gets, at the end of the day, I'm helping to create a game! 

## My Unconventional Wisdoms 🤔

- **Inheritance**: Not a fan.
  
- **Simplicity**: The true essence of genius. The simpler, the better. Elegance in minimalism.
  
- **Scrum**: More harm than good, where agile focused on building software, srum focusses on "process over development". 
  
- **Testing & TDD**: Love the former, not too keen on the latter. Testing is like making sure the parachute works. TDD? testing the air to check if the parachute will work, please don't do that!

That's a glimpse into my universe. Curious to know more or just discuss the beauty of simplicity in software? Let's connect!
