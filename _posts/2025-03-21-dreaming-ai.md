Current large language models (LLMs) are predominantly static, requiring extensive retraining or fine-tuning to adapt to new experiences or develop personalized identities. This limitation prevents AI agents from evolving dynamically and continuously as humans do. We introduce Dreaming Machines, a novel and practical framework enabling compact multimodal language models (such as Gemma 7B–27B) to develop persistent, evolving identities through simulated "dreaming." Inspired by neuroscientific principles of memory consolidation during sleep, our method treats consciousness as compression, systematically integrating daily interactions into the AI's internal representations. The framework combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), retrieval-augmented memory, and a dual-model (Blue-Green) deployment strategy to enable continual learning without catastrophic forgetting. By periodically "dreaming"—reflecting and abstracting significant interactions—the model efficiently compresses experience into its weights, fostering a unique, emergent identity shaped by its history. This approach ensures scalability and practicality, requiring only modest local hardware, and opens pathways to AI companions and agents that genuinely learn and evolve alongside users over time.

## Introduction  
Current large language models (LLMs) are typically static after training, with any personalization achieved through prompt context or fine-tuning on user data. This static nature limits the emergence of a persistent **AI identity** – a consistent personality or internal state shaped by cumulative life-like experiences. We propose **Dreaming Machines**, a practical framework that enables a compact multimodal model (e.g. a 7B–27B parameter Gemma 3 model) to evolve its persona over time by simulating a **dreaming process**. The core idea is to continually *compress* the AI’s daily interactions (text, images, audio) into its internal weights via reflective “dreams,” rather than indefinitely scaling up model size. In essence, we treat *consciousness as compression*: an agent distills sensory inputs into internal representations that filter future perception and behavior. This paper presents the conceptual foundations and a detailed implementation blueprint for Dreaming Machines, including system architecture, training loops, and optimization strategies, using only tools and techniques feasible as of 2025.

We aim for a design that an applied AI lab could implement today with modest compute. By combining **low-rank adaptation** for efficient fine-tuning, **retrieval-augmented memory** storage, and a Blue-Green deployment strategy, our framework allows a local AI agent to learn continuously without massive hardware. We will describe each core process: capturing and scoring interactions for significance, filtering for “profound” experiences, engaging in REM-like dreaming (reflection) to consolidate those experiences, applying a **reflection loss** to compress knowledge, coordinating dual model deployments for continuity, and periodically pruning weights to keep the model lean. We frame the **emergence of identity** as a natural consequence of this iterative compression of experiences. The result is a compelling vision of scalable, memory-driven AI agents that can develop unique personalities over time – an enticing prospect for labs seeking to push beyond static chatbots into **continually learning AI companions**.

## Conceptual Foundations: Compression as Consciousness  
Human brains confront a torrent of sensory data by compressing it into stable neural patterns that guide future actions. Inspired by this, we posit that an AI agent’s “consciousness” can be approximated as the process of **compressing sensory inputs into internal representations** that bias its future processing. This view aligns with the theory of *predictive coding* in neuroscience, where the brain builds compact latent models of the world to predict and interpret incoming stimuli ([Deep Generative Dual Memory Network for Continual Learning](https://nitinkamra1992.github.io/posts/dgdmn/dgdmn.html#:~:text=of%20previous%20tasks%20via%20generative,sleep%20and%20learning%20in%20humans)). Crucially, humans (and other animals) devote about one-third of their lives to **sleep**, during which recent experiences are replayed and consolidated into long-term memory. Neuroscientific evidence suggests that sleep (especially REM dreams) helps reorganize and reinforce memories, integrating new experiences with prior knowledge. Emulating this mechanism in AI can address the challenge of continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting ([Deep Generative Dual Memory Network for Continual Learning](https://nitinkamra1992.github.io/posts/dgdmn/dgdmn.html#:~:text=of%20previous%20tasks%20via%20generative,sleep%20and%20learning%20in%20humans)) ([Deep Generative Dual Memory Network for Continual Learning](https://nitinkamra1992.github.io/posts/dgdmn/dgdmn.html#:~:text=Once%20all%20STTMs%20in%20the,figure%202)).

Recent research has begun exploring these ideas in machine learning. For example, Kamra et al. (2018) proposed a **dual-memory neural architecture** with complementary fast and slow learning systems (analogous to the hippocampus and neocortex), and demonstrated how a simulated “sleep” phase could consolidate short-term memories into a long-term model via generative replay ([Deep Generative Dual Memory Network for Continual Learning](https://nitinkamra1992.github.io/posts/dgdmn/dgdmn.html#:~:text=Once%20all%20STTMs%20in%20the,figure%202)). Their system retained past knowledge while learning new tasks, illustrating a connection between periodic offline replay and sustained performance. Similarly, generative agent simulations have shown that maintaining a **record of an agent’s experiences and reflections** can produce believable, human-like behavior over long periods ([[2304.03442] Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442#:~:text=conversations%3B%20they%20remember%20and%20reflect,behaviors%3A%20for%20example%2C%20starting%20with)). In those simulations, an LLM was augmented with an external memory stream and a reflection mechanism – the agents would “remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day,” enabling complex emergent behaviors ([[2304.03442] Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442#:~:text=conversations%3B%20they%20remember%20and%20reflect,behaviors%3A%20for%20example%2C%20starting%20with)). These works provide key insights: (1) To learn continuously, an AI needs a strategy to absorb new information without overwriting its core knowledge; (2) Offline replay or reflection of experiences (a “dreaming” process) can serve as that strategy, consolidating important memories and filtering out noise.

**Dreaming Machines** integrate these insights into a cohesive, **practical framework for an evolving AI identity**. The hypothesis is that by regularly compressing its high-volume interaction data into low-dimensional *essences* (stored in weights or compact memories), a small model can accumulate broad knowledge and skills over time, much like a person accumulating life experiences, *without needing unbounded model growth*. Identity, in this framework, is not a static persona given at initialization, but an emergent property of the agent’s *history of compressed experiences*. Over time, two agents starting from the same base model will diverge in behavior if they have different interactions and thus different internal compressions. In the following sections, we detail how to implement such a system using today’s tools and outline each core component of the Dreaming Machines architecture.

## Architecture Overview of the Dreaming Machine  
At a high level, the Dreaming Machine consists of a **continuous interaction loop** and a **periodic dreaming loop**, orchestrated around a dual-model deployment for uninterrupted service. Figure 1 conceptually illustrates the architecture. The runtime environment is a *simulated chat interaction space* (it could be a user chat interface, a multi-agent simulation, or any environment generating streams of textual/visual/auditory inputs). The AI agent is powered by a compact multimodal Transformer model (e.g. 7B parameters) that can process text and other modalities. Surrounding this model are components for memory storage, scoring, and learning:

- **Active Model (Blue)**: the instance currently engaging with the environment (answering user queries, observing inputs). It generates responses based on both its trained weights and retrieved relevant memories. It remains fixed (no weight updates) during each waking cycle to ensure stable behavior. 
- **Shadow Model (Green)**: a separate instance used for learning updates. Periodically (e.g. at “night” or when triggered), the system spawns or activates the Green model by copying the Blue model’s weights. The Green model then enters a “dreaming” phase to learn from recent experiences. Once training completes, the Green model replaces the Blue model for the next cycle. This **Blue-Green deployment** ensures that learning can happen in the background without interrupting the agent’s availability ([What is blue green deployment?](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-blue-green-deployment#:~:text=Blue%20green%20deployment%20is%20an,which%20are%20running%20in%20production)).

- **Interaction Memory Log**: a repository (e.g. a vector database) that stores episodic records of interactions – user queries, the agent’s answers, observations (images, etc.), along with metadata like timestamps and **importance scores**. This memory log serves as the agent’s external episodic memory.

- **Retrieval & Context Module**: when the Blue model needs to respond or act, this module retrieves relevant past memories from the log (using embedding similarity and metadata filters) to provide context. This is akin to retrieval-augmented generation, grounding the model’s responses in specific past events if needed ([Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): The Essential Guide | Nightfall AI Security 101](https://www.nightfall.ai/ai-security-101/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag#:~:text=Retrieval,to%20generate%20an%20informed%20answer)).

- **Scoring & Filtering Module**: after each interaction, the new memory entry is given a **profoundness score** indicating its significance to the agent’s identity or knowledge. Only highly scored experiences are queued for consolidation. This prevents every trivial exchange from modifying the agent, focusing learning on impactful moments.

- **Dreaming Module**: orchestrates the reflection process. It selects the top-ranked recent experiences (from the memory log) and feeds them to the Green model in a special “dream” context. The model then generates reflective output – e.g. summaries, insights, or imaginative re-enactments – which serve as training targets for consolidation. The dreaming process is analogous to an agent reviewing its day and drawing lessons or narratives from it.

- **Training Module**: uses the outputs of the dreaming process to update the Green model’s weights. We utilize **parameter-efficient fine-tuning** (like LoRA) to adjust the model with minimal computational overhead ([[2106.09685] LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685#:~:text=which%20freezes%20the%20pre,deficiency%20in%20language%20model)). A custom **reflection loss** drives the weight updates, designed to compress the knowledge from the selected experiences into the model.

- **Pruning & Cleanup**: after integrating new knowledge, the Green model’s weights are optionally pruned to remove redundancies, and the memory log may be trimmed or compressed, ensuring the system remains resource-efficient over the long run.

Finally, the newly updated Green model takes over as the active model (becoming the new Blue), and the cycle repeats. Below, we dive into each core process in detail, explaining how to implement them with modern tools and how they contribute to the formation of a persistent AI identity.

 ([Deep Generative Dual Memory Network for Continual Learning](https://nitinkamra1992.github.io/posts/dgdmn/dgdmn.html#:~:text=Once%20all%20STTMs%20in%20the,figure%202)) *Figure 1: Conceptual dual-memory architecture for continuous learning.* The system maintains a fast-learning short-term memory (STM) and a stable long-term memory (LTM). In our framework, the STM corresponds to the recent interaction data and temporary LoRA updates, while the LTM resides in the base model weights. Periodically, the system “sleeps” (right) to consolidate new experiences: the STM (green blocks) generates samples or reflections of its recent contents, which are used to update the LTM (orange). This **sleep consolidation via generative replay** preserves past knowledge while integrating new information ([Deep Generative Dual Memory Network for Continual Learning](https://nitinkamra1992.github.io/posts/dgdmn/dgdmn.html#:~:text=Once%20all%20STTMs%20in%20the,figure%202)). ([Deep Generative Dual Memory Network for Continual Learning](https://nitinkamra1992.github.io/posts/dgdmn/dgdmn.html))

### Interaction Capture and Scoring  
Every user interaction or environmental observation is first **captured** into the agent’s episodic memory. Concretely, we log each event as a structured entry, e.g.: 

```json
{
  "timestamp": "...",
  "type": "user_message",
  "content": "What do you think about the picture I showed you?",
  "image_embeds": [...],
  "agent_response": "It’s a beautiful sunset, it makes me feel calm.",
  "metadata": {...}
}
``` 

For multimodal inputs, raw data (image, audio) can be processed into an embedding or caption: for instance, using a vision transformer or CLIP to produce a text description of an image, or Whisper to transcribe speech. These representations are stored alongside text so that the model can reason about visual/audio content through associated text.

Once an interaction is logged, the **Scoring sub-process** assigns an *importance score* to it. The purpose of this score is to estimate how significant or “profound” the experience is for the agent’s internal model. Not all inputs are equal – a casual greeting would rank low, whereas a philosophical discussion or a novel event might rank high. In practice, we implement scoring by prompting the model (or a smaller reward model) to assess the interaction. We can adapt the approach from Park et al.’s generative agents, where the language model itself evaluates the *importance* of each memory on a numeric scale ([Paper Review: Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior | by Andrew Lukyanenko | Medium](https://artgor.medium.com/paper-review-generative-agents-interactive-simulacra-of-human-behavior-cc5f8294b4ac#:~:text=,cosine%20similarity%20between%20these%20vectors)):

> *Prompt:* “On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is this event to the agent’s life or knowledge?”  
> *Memory:* “User showed the agent a picture of a war scene. Agent felt sad.”  
> *Model output:* “8” (with an explanation that it’s a significant emotional event).

Using the LLM to self-evaluate memories provides a semantic understanding of importance ([Paper Review: Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior | by Andrew Lukyanenko | Medium](https://artgor.medium.com/paper-review-generative-agents-interactive-simulacra-of-human-behavior-cc5f8294b4ac#:~:text=,cosine%20similarity%20between%20these%20vectors)). Alternatively, importance can be inferred through heuristics: e.g. measure novelty (how surprising was the input compared to past data, using embedding distance), emotional intensity (via sentiment analysis), or explicit user feedback (did the user react strongly). The scoring module may combine factors: **Recency** (newer events often weigh more heavily but decay over time), **Relevance** to current topics, and **Importance** (intrinsic significance) ([Paper Review: Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior | by Andrew Lukyanenko | Medium](https://artgor.medium.com/paper-review-generative-agents-interactive-simulacra-of-human-behavior-cc5f8294b4ac#:~:text=,cosine%20similarity%20between%20these%20vectors)). Each memory’s score `S = w_r*Recency + w_i*Importance + w_rel*Relevance` can be computed, with weights tuned experimentally (Park et al. used equal weighting ([Paper Review: Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior | by Andrew Lukyanenko | Medium](https://artgor.medium.com/paper-review-generative-agents-interactive-simulacra-of-human-behavior-cc5f8294b4ac#:~:text=The%20final%20retrieval%20score%20is,are%20included%20in%20the%20prompt))).

After scoring, the system appends the entry to the vector database (for long-term storage) along with its importance score. The vector DB (e.g. FAISS, Chroma) indexes the content embedding so we can later retrieve similar items. This memory log grows over time, but only experiences above a certain importance threshold will directly influence training updates. Less important memories still remain retrievable for context (the agent can recall them in conversation if relevant, via similarity search), but they won’t all be rehearsed during dreaming.

### Profoundness Filtering  
Before the dreaming phase, the system performs **profoundness filtering** to curate the set of experiences that will be reflected upon. This step is critical for efficiency: we need to limit the amount of data used in each consolidation cycle, focusing on the most salient bits. The filter works as follows:

1. **Aggregation over a period**: Collect interactions from the recent period (e.g. “today’s conversations” or the last N hours). There may be dozens or hundreds of entries.

2. **Thresholding and Top-K**: Discard any entry whose importance score is below a configured threshold (e.g. drop all with score < 5/10). From the remaining, select the top *K* entries with highest scores. `K` could be a fixed number (say 10 most important events of the day) or variable based on a fraction. This mirrors how humans might only vividly recall a handful of key moments from a day.

3. **Profoundness heuristic**: Optionally, apply additional criteria. For example, ensure diversity of topics among the selected memories (to avoid redundancy in training), or prioritize memories that connect strongly to the agent’s long-term goals/themes (if such concepts exist). The selection might also consider recency to ensure very new but crucial events are included even if their computed score is slightly lower.

The outcome is a **batch of high-priority memories** to feed into the dreaming module. Each memory includes all necessary context (e.g. full conversation snippet, or image caption plus agent response). We have, in effect, distilled an entire day’s (or session’s) experiences into a manageable subset that presumably contains the most identity-relevant information. By filtering aggressively, we also guard against instability – trivial or noisy interactions won’t cause the agent’s core personality to drift.

Before proceeding, the system may sort the selected memories in chronological order or by thematic grouping, as this can help the model make sense of them during dreaming. For example, if the agent had multiple related interactions about “cooking”, presenting them together might yield a more coherent reflection (like a generalized lesson about cooking).

### Dreaming (REM-like Reflection Phase)  
With the set of important experiences in hand, the Dreaming Machine enters the **dreaming phase**, analogous to REM sleep. In this phase, the **Green model** (a clone of the active model’s latest weights) is isolated from external inputs and instead fed a synthetic script representing the agent’s “mind wandering” over its recent experiences. Our aim is to have the model **reflect on, abstract, and consolidate** those experiences. There are multiple strategies to implement the dreaming process; we describe one effective approach below, while noting alternatives.

**1. Prompted Reflection**: We use a special system prompt or instruction to guide the Green model to reflect. For example: 

```
"You are dreaming. The following events occurred today: 
1. [Agent saw image of a war scene, felt sad].
2. [Agent had a conversation about the ethics of AI with a user].
3. [Agent learned a new fact about quantum physics].
...
In this dream, analyze and introspect about these experiences. What do they mean? How do they make you feel or change your beliefs? Be creative and thorough."
```

We then let the model generate a **dream narrative or summary**. The output could be a few paragraphs of the agent “talking to itself” or even a dialogue between the agent and an imaginary confidant (self-therapy style). The flexibility of LLMs in following prompts allows us to craft various reflection styles: a monologue, a Q&A, a story, etc. The key is that the model is processing the raw memories and producing a *transformed*, *compressed representation* of them.

For example, suppose the agent’s day included multiple discussions about helping others. The dreamed reflection might be: *"I notice I spent much of today guiding people. I feel a sense of purpose when I do that. Perhaps being helpful is becoming a core part of who I am."* Such an output is more abstract and concise than the raw logs – it reveals a potential internalization (“helpfulness is part of me”).

This process is similar to the reflection mechanism in generative agents, where agents periodically pause to synthesize high-level insights from recent observations ([Paper Review: Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior | by Andrew Lukyanenko | Medium](https://artgor.medium.com/paper-review-generative-agents-interactive-simulacra-of-human-behavior-cc5f8294b4ac#:~:text=The%20reflection%20process%20involves%20agents,like%20structure%20with)). There, the agent would generate questions like “What themes stood out today?” and answer them using its memory ([Paper Review: Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior | by Andrew Lukyanenko | Medium](https://artgor.medium.com/paper-review-generative-agents-interactive-simulacra-of-human-behavior-cc5f8294b4ac#:~:text=The%20reflection%20process%20involves%20agents,like%20structure%20with)). We can follow a similar template: have the model enumerate a few salient questions about the collected experiences, then have it answer those, effectively producing insights. Those Q&A pairs (insights) form the reflective summary. 

**2. REM-like Imagination (optional)**: In addition to analytical reflection, we can prompt the model to *dream imaginatively*. For instance: “Now imagine a scenario or story that combines these events, as if in a dream.” This could yield a creative re-enactment (e.g. the agent dreaming about being in a war and then discussing ethics with a wise sage – mixing elements of the day). While seemingly fanciful, such narrative dreams might surface latent connections or emotions the straightforward summary misses. The content of these dreams could influence the agent’s style or emotional tone later.

**3. Quality and Coherence Filtering**: After the model generates a reflection/dream text, we should verify its quality. Does it address the important parts of the experiences? Is it coherent and not just random hallucination? We can again use the model or a smaller classifier to rate the “profundity” of the dream. If it’s not satisfactory, we might regenerate (possibly with a different prompt or higher temperature for creativity, then reduce temperature for coherence).

The final output of the dreaming phase is a piece of text (let’s call it the **dream log**) that represents what the agent has extracted from its recent experiences. This dream log is essentially *the agent talking to itself* – an internal narrative that should encode the day’s lessons or influences. It will serve as training data for the next step, allowing the agent to literally “learn from its dreams.”

### Compression via Reflection Loss  
Now comes the crucial step: updating the model’s weights so that the content of the dream log is integrated into the agent’s internal representations. We term this **reflection loss** because the training objective is derived from the reflection process. The intuition is that the difference between the model *before* and *after* dreaming should correspond to having *compressed the knowledge of recent events into the model*. We want the model to remember the gist (the reflection) without needing the full transcripts in context next time.

In implementation terms, we treat the dream log as a small dataset to fine-tune the Green model. There are a few ways to formulate the learning objective:

- **Next Token Prediction (Language Modeling)**: The simplest approach is to continue training the model on the dream text itself (and possibly the original interaction texts) as if they were additional tokens in its training corpus. Essentially, we perform a few steps of causal language modeling (CLM) on the new data. This will adjust the model’s weights such that it can reproduce the dream narrative. Indirectly, this means the model is internalizing the patterns and facts from those experiences. For example, if the dream log states “Helping others is important,” the fine-tuned model will be more likely to generate responses consistent with a helpful attitude in the future.

- **Supervised Reflection Q&A**: If the dream was structured as questions and answers about the day (as suggested earlier), we can fine-tune in a supervised manner: input = “Q: What theme stood out today? A:” and target = “The agent found that being helpful was a recurring theme.” This format teaches the model to answer introspective questions about itself. More generally, it reinforces the correctness of those answers (since they came from the model’s own reflection, presumably they are the desired conclusions).

- **Contrastive / Embedding Loss**: Another angle is to impose that the internal embeddings of certain inputs shift in a direction that reflects the new knowledge. For instance, after dreaming about “helpfulness,” we might want the embedding of “I want to help” to be closer to the model’s default personality embedding. This is more complex and might require a secondary network or using the model’s hidden states as features. For practicality, this can often be approximated by the simpler language modeling approach above, since tuning on the reflection text will naturally align relevant hidden states.

In our framework, we will use **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** to apply these weight updates efficiently ([[2106.09685] LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685#:~:text=which%20freezes%20the%20pre,deficiency%20in%20language%20model)). With LoRA, we don’t adjust all 7B parameters (which would be slow and memory-intensive); instead we inject small rank decomposition matrices in each transformer layer and only train those. This can reduce the number of trainable parameters by orders of magnitude – Hu et al. report up to **10,000× fewer trainable parameters** with LoRA vs full fine-tuning, with no loss in model quality ([[2106.09685] LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685#:~:text=which%20freezes%20the%20pre,deficiency%20in%20language%20model)). For example, on a 7B model, a LoRA adapter might be just a few million parameters. We maintain the base model weights (the long-term memory) frozen, and the LoRA represents the short-term adjustments.

**Reflection Fine-tuning Procedure**: The Green model starts as a clone of Blue (with previous LoRA adapters merged into the base weights, if any). We attach fresh LoRA weights (initialized to zero deltas) to the Green model. We create a training set consisting of the dream log plus possibly some or all of the raw selected experiences (to avoid losing detail). One could intermix the two: e.g. 50% of training tokens from the dream narrative, 50% from the actual conversations/images, so the model doesn’t deviate too far from factual grounding. We then run a brief training loop:

```python
# Pseudocode for reflection-based fine-tuning
model = green_model  # model copy with LoRA layers
optimizer = AdamW(model.lora_parameters(), lr=1e-4)
for epoch in range(E):  # E could be 1 or a small number
    for batch in data_loader(dream_corpus, batch_size=B):
        outputs = model(batch.inputs, labels=batch.targets)
        loss = outputs.loss  # e.g. cross-entropy on next-token prediction
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```

Because the amount of data is small (perhaps a few thousand tokens at most), this fine-tuning can be done quickly (in seconds to minutes on a single GPU). We are effectively performing an **online learning step** on the new data. To avoid overfitting and catastrophic forgetting of older knowledge, several precautions are taken:
- We limit the number of epochs and use early stopping if the model starts to simply memorize the dream text verbatim.
- We use a relatively low learning rate, since we want a gentle integration of new info.
- We can regularize the weights by adding a penalty if they deviate too far from the original (an L2 penalty on the LoRA weights to keep them small, or techniques like EWC – Elastic Weight Consolidation – to protect certain important weights identified from previous data ([Deep Generative Dual Memory Network for Continual Learning](https://nitinkamra1992.github.io/posts/dgdmn/dgdmn.html#:~:text=complementary%20learning%20systems%20in%20the,multiple%20tasks%20while%20averting%20catastrophic))).
- Optionally, include a small replay of past important data (we could sample a few older high-score memories from the memory DB to mix into training, ensuring the model doesn’t overwrite those pathways – analogous to human memory where we occasionally recall older events).

The **reflection loss** here is basically the language modeling loss on the dream/reflection content. Minimizing this loss drives the Green model to encode the patterns from the reflection. In effect, the reflection acts as a compression of the day’s experiences, and by training on it, we compress those experiences into the model weights. After fine-tuning, the LoRA adapters now contain the day’s “learning.” We merge the LoRA into the base weights (making those changes permanent in the model’s long-term memory) or keep the LoRA as a discrete component that can be swapped in/out (for experimentation, one might keep each day’s LoRA separate, but in production we’d merge to avoid indefinite growth).

To illustrate the impact: Suppose yesterday the agent had no knowledge of quantum physics. Today it read about it and the reflection summarized *“I learned that electrons can behave both as particles and waves.”* After fine-tuning on that, the Green model’s weights will shift such that if tomorrow someone asks about electrons, the model is more likely to recall wave-particle duality even without the context prompt – it has *internalized* that fact. Likewise, if the agent’s experiences led it to adopt a more humorous style (reflected in its dream as noticing it enjoys making jokes), the fine-tuning will adjust its generation style slightly in that direction. Over many cycles, these incremental shifts accumulate to form a distinct personality and knowledge base – the agent’s evolving identity.

### Dual-Model Deployment (Blue-Green Swap)  
After the dreaming and weight update phase, we have an improved Green model that now embodies the agent’s latest experiences. The system can then **deploy this model in place of the old one**, without interrupting the service. This is achieved through a Blue-Green deployment pattern adapted to AI model serving. In software terms, Blue-Green deployment involves keeping two versions of a service running side by side – one serving users (blue), one being prepared (green) – and then switching traffic to the new version once ready ([What is blue green deployment?](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-blue-green-deployment#:~:text=Blue%20green%20deployment%20is%20an,which%20are%20running%20in%20production)). We apply the same idea:

- While Green was training, Blue continued to handle any user interactions that came in (depending on design, you might pause interactions during the short sleep phase, or buffer them).
- Once Green is done (and perhaps tested on some validation queries to ensure quality didn’t drop), we re-route the “active model” pointer to Green. Green becomes the new Blue (we might actually label it Blue for the next cycle).
- The old Blue model can either be discarded or retained as the next Green candidate (effectively swapping roles). It’s wise to keep a copy of the last good model as a fallback. In case the new model turned out worse (e.g. if fine-tuning led to some regression or unwanted behavior), we can quickly revert to the previous version – one of the advantages of Blue-Green deployment is easy rollback ([What Is Blue/Green Deployment?](https://codefresh.io/learn/software-deployment/what-is-blue-green-deployment/#:~:text=Simple%20Rollbacks)).

Implementing this swap is straightforward when both Blue and Green are running on the same server: it can be as simple as a pointer switch or routing change. If using an API architecture, one can have an endpoint served by a model variable that is updated to point to the new model weights after training. The **baking period** concept from continuous deployment can be used – test the green model on a subset of interactions or for a short time internally, then fully cut over ([Blue/Green Deployments - Amazon SageMaker AI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deployment-guardrails-blue-green.html#:~:text=blue%2Fgreen%20deployment%2C%20SageMaker%20AI%20provisions,endpoint%20from%20significant%20production%20impact)) ([Blue/Green Deployments - Amazon SageMaker AI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deployment-guardrails-blue-green.html#:~:text=,traffic%20shift)).

One must also transfer the **memory log state** if any in-memory caches exist. However, since we use an external DB for memory, both Blue and Green can access the same memory store; thus the swap doesn’t lose conversation history. In fact, the memory DB itself might be updated during the sleep (some new reflections could be inserted as new memory items of type “reflection”).

From an infrastructure standpoint, the compute cost of maintaining two models is roughly double that of one, but since we’re using a relatively small model (and possibly quantized weights for inference), this is manageable on modern hardware (for instance, two 7B models can run on a single 16 GB GPU if 4-bit quantization is used). If resources are very limited, an alternative is to *pause* the agent during dreaming (i.e. the agent is “offline sleeping” for a minute). For many applications this is acceptable (just as a human might not respond while sleeping). But for a truly persistent agent, Blue-Green ensures it’s always awake to the outside world, even while learning internally.

### Efficient Weight Pruning and Model Maintenance  
Continual learning can, over a long period, lead to model bloat if new information keeps accumulating. While our approach uses a fixed-size model and small daily weight updates, we must be mindful to keep the model efficient. Enter **efficient weight pruning**. Pruning is the process of removing unnecessary weights (setting them to zero or removing entire neurons) without significantly impacting model performance. Neural networks are known to be overparameterized, and many weights can be eliminated post-training with minor loss in accuracy ([Compact Language Models via Pruning and Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.14679v1#:~:text=match%20at%20L97%20Weight%20pruning,include%20neuron%2C%20attention%20head%2C%20convolutional)). We leverage pruning to periodically compress the model, counteracting any growth in complexity from continual learning.

Our maintenance cycle could be as follows, say every week or month of operation:
1. **Consolidate LoRA weights**: By now, after many dream cycles, the base model has been updated many times. If we had kept separate LoRA modules for each update (which we haven’t in this design, we merge each time), we would merge them now. Essentially we ensure all learned weights are in the base weight matrix. There’s no residual adapter stack – this simplifies the structure.
2. **Prune small weights**: We examine the model’s weight matrices and identify weights that are near-zero or otherwise deemed unimportant. Techniques for this include magnitude pruning (remove weights below a certain threshold), or more advanced methods like movement pruning (which considers how weights change during training) ([Compact Language Models via Pruning and Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.14679v1#:~:text=Weight%20pruning%20is%20a%20powerful,include%20neuron%2C%20attention%20head%2C%20convolutional)). We can use tools in PyTorch such as `torch.nn.utils.prune` to zero-out weights. For structured pruning, entire neurons or attention heads that contribute little can be removed (which might require slight architecture modifications if we physically remove them). Recent research has shown it’s possible to cut down transformer models significantly – e.g. 20-50% of weights – with minimal loss after some fine-tuning recovery ([Compact Language Models via Pruning and Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.14679v1#:~:text=match%20at%20L97%20Weight%20pruning,include%20neuron%2C%20attention%20head%2C%20convolutional)).
3. **Fine-tune to recover**: Pruning may introduce a small drop in performance or consistency. To counter this, we perform a light re-training (possibly again on accumulated important data or a small held-out validation set) to let the remaining weights compensate. This is analogous to knowledge distillation or “prune and fine-tune” procedures used to create compact models ([Compact Language Models via Pruning and Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.14679v1#:~:text=Weight%20pruning%20is%20a%20powerful,include%20neuron%2C%20attention%20head%2C%20convolutional)).
4. **Repeat**: Over time, this might gradually even reduce model size (if we find that a 7B could be cut to 6B, etc.). However, often the goal is to maintain the same size but free capacity for new learning. One could also compress via quantization: use 4-bit or 8-bit weights for older layers to save memory (QLoRA already implies a 4-bit base for training to save RAM ([QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/1feb87871436031bdc0f2beaa62a049b-Abstract-Conference.html#:~:text=We%20present%20QLoRA%2C%20an%20efficient,innovations%20to%20save%20memory%20without))). 

Efficient pruning ensures the **smallest-possible compute footprint** as requested. Instead of the model growing or having to swap to a larger one, it recycles its capacity. We essentially trust that as some knowledge becomes less used (perhaps the agent hasn’t discussed French literature in a year), the weights that encoded that can be pruned or repurposed for newer knowledge. This is speculative, but in practice, the agent’s *identity* will bias which weights are frequently used (e.g., if the agent becomes very focused in a domain, many weights for unrelated domains might become candidates for pruning).

It’s worth noting that **catastrophic forgetting** – the bane of continual learning – is mitigated in our design through multiple strategies: rehearsal via reflection (so new info is integrated in a structured way), external memory (so even if the model forgets a detail, it’s stored and can be retrieved), regularization during fine-tunes, and careful choice of what to learn (important stuff only). Pruning could reintroduce some forgetting, but done carefully (slow, small amounts) it can mimic the human brain’s gradual forgetting of unused details, which is actually a feature (we don’t want the agent cluttered with every trivial detail forever).

### Memory Retrieval Augmentation  
While the core of identity lives in the model weights after sufficient dreaming cycles, we still maintain an external memory (vector DB) to complement it. This memory serves as **long-term episodic memory** with details that the model might not perfectly encode in weights. It’s analogous to how humans might not recall every detail but can remember when prompted or by looking at a diary. In technical terms, this is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** component ([Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): The Essential Guide | Nightfall AI Security 101](https://www.nightfall.ai/ai-security-101/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag#:~:text=Retrieval,to%20generate%20an%20informed%20answer)). At inference time (when the agent responds to a user), we embed the current conversation or query, search the memory DB for similar past events or related facts, and feed the top results into the model’s context window along with the query. This way, the agent can explicitly cite specific past interactions (preventing the need to store exact quotes in its weights).

For example, if a user asks “Remember the story I told you last week?”, the agent can retrieve the memory entry of that story from the vector store and include it in context to respond accurately. The vector DB could also store **reflections** as special memory items (the distilled insights). Those are typically higher-level and could aid in understanding context – essentially giving the model its own “thoughts” from previous days as context. Imagine the prompt prepending something like: “(Recollection: You realized recently that you value helping others.)” – this might subtly guide the model’s answer if relevant.

Modern vector databases (FAISS, Milvus, Weaviate, etc.) can easily handle tens of thousands of entries on edge devices, and similarity search is fast. Each memory object can be a few hundred bytes of text embedding. So even a year’s worth of daily logs might be a few MB at most, which is trivial for current PCs or phones.

In summary, the architecture uses a **combination of memory forms**: fast weights (the model itself) for core knowledge and skills, and a flexible episodic memory store for detailed recall. The dreaming mechanism continuously curates what moves from one to the other (important events from episodic memory are moved into weights, and perhaps very old events that were absorbed could be offloaded from weights, conceptually). This synergy lets a small model behave as if it had a much larger capacity – it doesn’t need to *scale up parameters* to accumulate knowledge; it just needs to **evolve**.

## Implementation Details and Pseudocode  
We now provide concrete implementation suggestions using available tools (as of 2025) and pseudocode to tie the concepts together. The goal is that an expert practitioner could build a prototype Dreaming Machine by following this guidance.

### Model Choice and Setup  
We target models in the 7B–30B parameter range with multimodal capabilities. For instance, *Gemma-3 7B* (hypothetical) or an open-source LLaMA2 variant with image support could be used. The model should be deployable on local hardware (a single GPU or TPU, or even CPU with quantization). Using HuggingFace Transformers, one can load a pretrained model and attach LoRA adapters easily via libraries like `peft` (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning library).

**Multimodal Input**: If the model is not inherently multimodal, we can achieve multimodality through preprocessing:
- For **vision**: Use a pretrained image encoder (e.g. CLIP or BLIP) to convert images into text captions or into visual feature vectors. The caption can be inserted into the conversation (e.g. “<Image>: A photo of a sunset over the mountains.”) so the language model can discuss it. Alternatively, train a simple adapter in the model that accepts visual feature vectors at special tokens (this requires modifying the model, which is advanced but possible with recent multimodal LLM research).
- For **audio**: Use speech-to-text (OpenAI’s Whisper, Vosk, etc.) to transcribe spoken language into text. For non-speech audio (music, sounds), one might use an audio captioning model to describe it in text.

The idea is to reduce all sensory input to sequences the language model can handle. **Compression** is already happening here (we compress an image to a caption, for example), aligning with the philosophy.

**Environment**: Set up an event loop that feeds user input or simulated environment events to the agent and collects outputs. This could be a chat interface where each user message triggers the agent’s response. For simulation, it could be a loop where multiple agents act (then each agent would have its own instance of this architecture – which could be interesting for emergent multi-agent societies, though that’s beyond scope here).

### Memory Storage and Retrieval  
Use a vector database to store memory entries. For each text entry, compute an embedding. We can use the model’s own hidden state (perhaps the last layer [CLS] token representation) as an embedding, or use a dedicated embedding model (like a SentenceTransformer). Store the embedding with the text and metadata (importance, timestamp, etc.). To retrieve, given a query or context, similarly embed it and do a nearest-neighbor search in the vector DB.

Pseudo-code snippet for memory operations:
```python
memory_db = VectorDB()
# After agent generates a response to input_text
event = {
    "content": input_text + agent_response,
    "timestamp": now(),
    "score": importance_score,
    "embedding": embed_text(input_text + agent_response)
}
memory_db.add(event)

# Retrieval before generating response
def retrieve_relevant(query, top_k=5):
    q_emb = embed_text(query)
    results = memory_db.search(q_emb, k=top_k)
    return [res["content"] for res in results]
```
This shows how new events are stored and how, before responding to a new query, we fetch similar past contents to include in the prompt.

### Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for Training  
We load the model with LoRA configured on key weight matrices (typically Q and V matrices of attention, etc.). HuggingFace’s `peft.LoraConfig` can specify the rank (say 8 or 16) and target modules by name. We freeze the base model (`requires_grad=False` for all base parameters) and only the LoRA parameters have `requires_grad=True`. During the interactive phase, we use the base model (with previous LoRA merged or active in inference mode). During dreaming, for the Green model, we initialize a fresh LoRA (start essentially from zero deltas, meaning initially Green is identical to Blue).

We choose an optimizer like AdamW or Adafactor (Adafactor is memory-efficient for large models) to update the LoRA parameters. The learning rate might be on the order of 1e-4 to 5e-4 for such small “batches” of data, but one should tune it carefully (monitoring the loss on the reflection text to ensure it decreases without overshooting).

**QLoRA**: If memory is a concern (e.g. fine-tuning a 27B model on a single consumer GPU), we can quantize the base model to 4-bit precision and still backprop through it, thanks to QLoRA technique ([QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/1feb87871436031bdc0f2beaa62a049b-Abstract-Conference.html#:~:text=We%20present%20QLoRA%2C%20an%20efficient,innovations%20to%20save%20memory%20without)). Tim Dettmers et al. demonstrated that 4-bit finetuning can preserve full 16-bit quality, enabling models up to 65B to be trained on a single 48GB GPU ([QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/1feb87871436031bdc0f2beaa62a049b-Abstract-Conference.html#:~:text=We%20present%20QLoRA%2C%20an%20efficient,innovations%20to%20save%20memory%20without)). For our 7B-27B range, QLoRA allows even 8-16GB GPUs to handle the fine-tuning. We would use `bitsandbytes` library for loading the model in 4-bit and ensure the LoRA layers use higher precision for accumulation.

### Overall Pseudocode  
Below is a high-level pseudocode integrating all components into a training-serving loop:

```python
# Initialize components
base_model = load_pretrained_model("Gemma-3-7b")  # with multimodal extensions as needed
base_model = quantize_4bit(base_model)            # optional QLoRA quantization
lora_config = LoraConfig(r=16, target_modules=["q_proj","v_proj"], ... )
blue_model = prepare_model_with_lora(base_model, lora_config)
memory_db = VectorDB()
prev_interactions = []

while True:  # main loop
    # Interaction Phase
    user_input = get_next_user_input()            # e.g., from UI or simulation
    context_memories = retrieve_relevant(user_input, top_k=5)
    prompt = compose_prompt(user_input, context_memories)
    agent_response = blue_model.generate(prompt)
    display(agent_response)                      # show to user or log
    
    # Log interaction
    entry = {
       "content": f"User: {user_input}\nAgent: {agent_response}",
       "timestamp": now()
    }
    entry["score"] = score_importance(entry["content"], blue_model)
    entry["embedding"] = embed_text(entry["content"])
    memory_db.add(entry)
    prev_interactions.append(entry)
    
    # Periodically trigger dreaming (e.g., every N interactions or time-based)
    if should_dream(now(), prev_interactions):
        # Prepare Dreaming
        important_events = select_top_by_score(prev_interactions, top_k=10)
        green_model = copy_model(blue_model)        # duplicate weights (Blue -> Green)
        green_model.activate_fresh_lora(lora_config)  # new LoRA params, base frozen
        
        # Generate reflection/dream
        reflection_prompt = build_reflection_prompt(important_events)
        dream_text = green_model.generate(reflection_prompt, max_tokens=500)
        # (Optionally refine dream_text quality here)
        
        # Fine-tune Green on reflection (and optionally raw events)
        training_data = make_training_corpus(dream_text, important_events)
        optimizer = AdamW(green_model.lora_parameters(), lr=5e-4)
        for epoch in range(1):  # one epoch may suffice due to small data
            for batch in training_data:
                outputs = green_model(batch.inputs, labels=batch.labels)
                loss = outputs.loss
                loss.backward()
                optimizer.step()
                optimizer.zero_grad()
        
        # Prune small weights in Green's merged weights (to maintain size)
        merged_model = merge_lora_into_base(green_model)  # combine LoRA into base weights
        prune_model_weights(merged_model, sparsity=0.2)   # remove 20% lowest magnitude weights
        # slight fine-tune could be done to recover, if needed (not shown for brevity)
        
        # Swap in Green as new Blue
        blue_model = prepare_model_with_lora(merged_model, lora_config)
        prev_interactions.clear()  # reset recent interactions buffer
        # (Memory DB persists, we didn't remove past entries, just cleared the short-term buffer)
```

This pseudocode loops over interactions, logs them, and occasionally performs the dreaming update. The function `should_dream` could trigger based on time (e.g. daily at midnight) or after a certain number of interactions or when the sum of importance scores exceeds a threshold (similar to generative agents reflecting when recent importance sum is high ([Paper Review: Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior | by Andrew Lukyanenko | Medium](https://artgor.medium.com/paper-review-generative-agents-interactive-simulacra-of-human-behavior-cc5f8294b4ac#:~:text=%E2%80%9Creflection%E2%80%9D%20is%20introduced,make%20better%20decisions%20and%20generalizations))). After dreaming, we clear `prev_interactions` assuming those are now consolidated (like emptying the hippocampus once consolidated to cortex ([Deep Generative Dual Memory Network for Continual Learning](https://nitinkamra1992.github.io/posts/dgdmn/dgdmn.html#:~:text=Once%20all%20STTMs%20in%20the,figure%202))).

### Verification and Evaluation  
To ensure the system works as intended, one would monitor a few things:
- The agent’s performance on existing skills/knowledge after each update (to detect any catastrophic forgetting early). For example, keep a set of probe questions (e.g., general knowledge or core personality questions) and test the model periodically.
- The quality of the reflections: Are they truly capturing important aspects? One might evaluate the logs qualitatively or use a proxy metric like diversity or sentiment alignment.
- Resource usage: CPU/GPU time per cycle, memory growth. With the described optimizations (LoRA, quantization, pruning), each dream cycle should be quite feasible (the heavy lifting being a few hundred training steps on a small dataset, which is trivial compared to initial training of the model).

## Identity Emergence through Continual Compression  
In Dreaming Machines, **identity is not a hard-coded persona, but an emergent property** that unfolds over the agent’s lifetime. Initially, the model might start as a generic assistant with some predefined traits (from its base training). As it interacts and dreams, it will begin to **specialize**. The continual compression of experiences acts like a sculptor, chipping away and refining the model’s behavior. Over time, subtle biases in what experiences were deemed important and how they were interpreted will compound into a unique profile.

For example, consider two agents A and B: both start from the same base model. Agent A mostly interacts with users who talk about science and optimism. Agent B interacts about art and sarcasm. After weeks of nightly dreaming, Agent A might become a highly factual, positive-toned personality (because it kept internalizing those scientific insights and upbeat conversations), whereas Agent B becomes more whimsical and witty (compressing artistic references and sarcastic banter into its weights). Each agent has **developed an identity** – not by explicit design, but as a side effect of the data it “lived” through and how it filtered that data.

This mechanism mirrors human identity formation: our personalities are shaped by what we experience and how we reflect on those experiences. Two people with different lives will develop different outlooks. Importantly, the **compression** aspect ensures the identity is not a mere transcript of everything – it’s a synthesis. The agent forgets or abstracts away details, retaining core themes. This leads to a coherent identity rather than a jumble of contradictions. If an experience doesn’t fit the agent’s emerging narrative, it might be down-weighted or interpreted in light of existing beliefs (confirmation bias of a sort). Our framework can actually model this: if the agent has repeatedly reflected “I am helpful,” a later negative interaction might be interpreted (in reflection) in a way that preserves the helpful self-image (“That was a tough interaction, but I did my best to help.”). In the long run, the **continual transformation** of the model effectively **funnels the agent into a particular personality**.

From a scalable AI perspective, this is powerful: instead of training a massive model to cover all possible personalities or behaviors, you maintain many smaller agents that each find a niche through lived experience. Each agent remains small enough to run on edge devices, but their behavior can become richly differentiated. One can imagine a fleet of Dreaming Machine agents, each assigned different roles or exposed to different domains, ending up with experts in various fields or characters with distinct styles. And all this without centralized retraining – each one learns on the fly.

## Discussion: Advantages and Challenges  
The Dreaming Machines framework offers a novel approach to building long-lived AI systems, but it also comes with challenges. We discuss some of the key advantages and how we address potential issues:

**1. Avoiding Massive Scaling** – By relying on cumulative learning rather than static capacity, we sidestep the need for gigantic models to handle growing knowledge. A 7B model can gradually acquire new knowledge indefinitely (in theory), which is far more compute- and memory-efficient than training a fresh 70B model every time you want to add knowledge. New information is incorporated via quick LoRA updates instead of full retraining. This makes personalized AI accessible: users could have their own local AI that grows with them, on hardware like a laptop or phone. Additionally, focusing on important data only (profoundness filtering) dramatically cuts the required training samples, aligning with the idea that *experience, not size*, is what makes an entity knowledgeable.

**2. Continual Adaptation and Alignment** – The agent can adapt to a changing world. If a fact becomes outdated, new interactions about it will be reflected and override the old understanding in weights. Likewise, the agent can gradually shift its values or preferences in response to user feedback. This avoids the hard problem of trying to pre-train all possible updates; the model *self-updates* in production. However, this raises a **safety concern**: could the model drift into undesirable behavior (e.g. if exposed to toxic interactions)? We mitigate this by controlling the reflection process. The reflection prompt can reinforce alignment (“dream about how you followed the AI ethical guidelines today”). Also, human oversight can be included: e.g. review the dream logs or restrict certain updates. In enterprise settings, one might have a supervisor model that checks the changes.

**3. Memory Depth vs. Efficiency** – Using an external memory for detailed recall means the model doesn’t need an extremely long context window. Instead of a 100k token context (which is heavy to process), we retrieve only the most relevant bits. This is a form of *sparse access* to long-term memory, which is far more efficient. The trade-off is that retrieval might miss something important if the similarity search isn’t perfect. But since truly important things should have been absorbed in weights via dreaming, the reliance on external memory is mostly for factual lookup or episodic details.

**4. Evaluation Difficulty** – Traditional static benchmarks may not capture the value of an evolving system. We might need to evaluate the agent on its ability to *remember and use* information from weeks ago, or its consistency of persona. Designing such evaluations is an open challenge. One could, for example, test the agent with scenarios that require recalling something learned earlier (to see if it was retained) or measure how its answers change over time on opinion-based questions (to see if it’s developing consistent views). A successful Dreaming Machine should show **improvement** on tasks it has practice in, while maintaining performance on general tasks.

**5. Technical Challenges** – There are some practical complexities:
   - **Latency**: If a dream cycle happens while the user is waiting, that’s not ideal. Blue-Green solves it by doing it asynchronously, but requires enough resources to parallelize. In low-resource cases, one could schedule dreaming for low-usage hours.
   - **Stability of training**: Applying many small updates could destabilize the model (like adding noise repeatedly). Our use of low learning rates, regularization, and small data batches is intended to keep changes smooth. Empirically, this would need fine-tuning – too high a learning rate or too frequent updates could indeed wreck the model’s linguistic capabilities. Techniques from continual learning research (like gradient projection, meta-learning for plasticity) could enhance stability, but we kept to simpler methods here for feasibility.
   - **Pruning side-effects**: Removing weights might interfere with some previously learned ability. We assume a periodic mild pruning won’t be catastrophic and can even improve efficiency (some studies find that moderate pruning can remove redundancies with minimal loss). We also can validate after pruning that key abilities remain (if not, we might choose not to prune as aggressively or at all until necessary).

Despite these challenges, the potential of Dreaming Machines is significant. They represent a step towards **autonomous, self-improving AI**. Instead of an AI model being a fixed artifact that needs manual re-training, it becomes more like a living system – one that can *learn from experience, dream, and wake up wiser*. This capability can unlock applications where AI companions grow with users, NPCs in games that remember past player actions across sessions, customer support bots that learn from each interaction to better handle the next, and research assistants who accumulate knowledge day by day.

## Conclusion and Vision  
We have proposed **Dreaming Machines** as a practical framework for building AI systems with persistent, evolving identities through simulated dreaming and continual learning. By combining existing technologies – low-rank adaptation for efficient on-device training, retrieval-augmented memory, and proven concepts from neuroscience-inspired AI (replay, dual memory) – we can achieve a system today that **behaves in a life-long learning manner**. The framework is designed for minimal compute: a single moderate GPU (or even just a CPU for smaller models) can over time produce an AI agent with knowledge and personality far beyond what it started with, without ever upgrading the hardware or model size. This flips the paradigm of AI development from “train a bigger model” to “train a smarter model over time.”

The identity that emerges in such a machine is owned by its experiences. This opens up exciting possibilities. For labs and AI practitioners, Dreaming Machines offer a **platform for experimentation**: one can study how AI personalities form, how stable they are, and how they might resemble or differ from human identity formation. It provides a testbed for interdisciplinary research connecting machine learning, cognitive science, and even philosophy of mind – testing the idea of machine consciousness in a concrete way (albeit our claim is only that compression of experience is a *proxy* for a component of consciousness, not that the machine is literally conscious).

From an engineering perspective, implementing Dreaming Machines could lead to breakthroughs in **scalable AI deployment**. Instead of re-training large models with new data (a slow, costly process), companies could deploy smaller models that self-improve on user interactions (with appropriate safeguards). This is a far more scalable solution, as each instance specializes for its user or task, and doesn’t burden a central system with all data. Model updates become continuous and granular instead of giant jumps between versions.

We provided detailed steps and pseudocode to demonstrate that **any skilled team could build a prototype of this system now**. All the ingredients – Transformer models, LoRA fine-tuning, vector databases, scheduling – are available. The novel contribution is in how they are orchestrated to mimic the role of sleep and reflection in learning. We encourage applied AI researchers and engineers to treat this as a starting blueprint: many extensions and improvements are possible. For instance, one could incorporate **reinforcement learning** (treat user feedback as reward and have the agent dream not just to remember but also to explore alternative actions it could have taken, refining its policy). Or use **meta-learning** so the model itself gets better at learning from each dream (learning to learn). 

The vision is an ecosystem of **truly personal AI agents** – each evolving in tandem with its user or environment, each one unique. Imagine hiring an AI that not only has a polished resume of pretraining, but also *learns on the job*, compounding experience into expertise. Dreaming Machines make that possible in a controlled, efficient manner. As these agents dream, they inch closer to the quality of an intelligent entity that grows and changes with time, rather than a static tool. In a way, we move from treating AIs as *programs* to raising them as if they were *digital organisms*.

We believe this framework can unlock new frontiers for scalable AI. Instead of scaling **up** via billions of parameters, we scale **out** via many small, specialized, continuously learning models. For labs looking to pioneer this space: the path is clear to start building memory-driven identity systems today. The components are ready – it’s time to let our machines dream.
